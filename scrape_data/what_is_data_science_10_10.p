vincent granville on february 19 2015 at 700pm  view blog       you sometimes hear from some oldfashioned statisticians that data scientists know nothing about statistics  and that they  the statisticians  know everything here we prove that actually it is the exact opposite data science has its own core of statistical science research in addition to data plumbing  statistical apis  and business  competitive intelligence research  here we highlight 11 major data science contributions to statistical science i am not aware of any statistical science contribution to data science but if you know one you are welcome to share heres the list  clustering using tagging or indexation methods see section 3 after clicking on the link allowing you to cluster text articles websites much faster than any traditional statistical technique with a scalable algorithm very easy to implement bucketization  the science and art of identifying the right homogeneous data buckets millions of buckets among billions of observations to provide highly localized or segmenttargeted predictions or to smooth regression parameters across similar buckets with strong statistical significance it is equivalent to joint not sequential binning in multiple dimensions which is a combinatorial optimization problem while decision trees also produce some bucketization the data science approach is more robust simple scalable and modelfree it does not directly produce decision trees and lead to easy interpretation each data bucket corresponding to a specific type of fraud in a fraud detection problem a related problem is bucket clustering via standard hierarchical clustering techniques random number generation  a 3000 year old problem benefited from data science advances for instance using the digits of irrational numbers such as pi or sqrt2 produced with very fast algorithms to simulate randomness modelfree confidence intervals  getting rid of p value hypothesis testing asymptotic analysis errors due to poor modelfitting or outliers and of a bunch of obscure statistical oldfashioned concepts variable  feature selection and data reduction  without using l2based modelbased techniques such as pca potentially numerically unstable which are sensitive to outliers and lead to difficult interpretation hidden decision trees  an hybrid technique combining some sort of averaged decision trees and jackknife regression more accurate and far easier to code implement and interpret than either logistic regression or traditional decision trees not subject to overfitting unlike its ancestor statistical techniques jackknife regression  a universal simplified regression technique easy to code and to integrate in blackbox analytical products traditional statistical science offers hundreds of regression techniques  nobody but statisticians know which one to use and when obviously a nightmare in production environments predictive power and other synthetic metrics designed for robustness rather than for mathematical elegance identification of true signal in data subject to the curse of big dat a spurious correlations new data visualization techniques  in particular using data video to display insights better goodnessoffit and yield metrics  based on robust l1 rather than outliersensitive l2 metrics all this research is available for free dsc resources career training  books  cheat

data science central to add comments  join data science central        comment by carlos aya on march 6 2015 at 210pm   dear vincent  unaware of any statistical science contribution to data science   tongue in cheek right   i do acknowledge that data abundance and more importantly the universal availability of computers have posed a tremendous challenge to mathematics and statistics anyone can modify an existing algorithm that fails and make it work for hisher particular case  or even invent new ones but this does not mean this is science in the sense that showing that it works even in many situations does not explain why they work and how they could fail ie what underlying assumptions are required for it to work yes it is published as research  but believe me it is more an unsolved problem for a mathematician or statistician than well founded finished research if you allow me the analogy is like that in ancient babylon it was common knowledge among builders that certain pythagorean triangles existed  but it required formal geometry to explain what was really going on so you want recent contributions here one search for functional data analysis in google scholar  enjoy  anyway data scientists and everybody  yes keep using computers your challenges are welcome but even better if you join the theoretical camp and help to explain why kind regards carlos       comment by george f hart on march 2 2015 at 852am   gday vincent as always i find your comment both interesting and insightful i have always regarded myself as a dataanalyst  even before the modern idea was invented im 80 i have also applied statistical reasoning for the past 60 years to data analysis i do agree that data scientists have contributed significantly to statistics in the sense i understand the field however to be unaware of any statistical science contribution to data science must have been ghostwritten it is not you as i have read you over the past few years i assume you are being provocative simply to get something going  which is my own method of teaching mathematical methods have nothing to do with it the underlying concepts of statistics are what statistical science has contributed to data analysis start with  what is the chance of a random sample taken from a location being simply a variant within the population of interest or alternatively that it is from a totally different population or the application of basic functions mean median sd var min max range summary  sort order rank  exp log sin cos tan radians  length  rev  sum cumsum prod cumprod round ceil floor signif  which whichmax  any all and mode or the basic model   y  something  error of measurement  where y is said to be the dependent variable that is being measured and something is some relationship among the socalled independent variables that control or predict y or rejecting the hypothesis vs failing to reject the hypothesis to judge the reliability of any experimental result it must be compared with an estimate of its error ie a test of significance the test of significance separates the subjective guess from fact more correctly the failure to reject a hypothesis pertaining to a fact or the innate control of error by multiple replication this provides a major advantage to and is a principal reason for the success of modern big data analysis it leads to theridea that in data analysis we are dealing with the total population not a statistical sample we both know that is not true but it is suffice to justify what is done i could go on but you and most of your reader know this stuff already data analysis has grown but it still have the underpinnings of statistical analysis for the future of statistical analysis i advise keeping a closeeye on deep learning methods

 it employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics  statistics  information theory and information technology  including signal processing  probability models  machine learning  statistical learning  computer programming  data engineering  pattern recognition and learning  visualization  predictive analytics  uncertainty modeling  data warehousing  data compression and high performance computing  methods that scale to big data are of particular interest in data science although the discipline is not generally considered to be restricted to such data the development of machine learning  a branch of artificial intelligence used to uncover patterns in data from which predictive models can be developed has enhanced the growth and importance of data science data scientists apply expertise in data preparation statistics and machine learning to investigate complex problems in many various domains such as marketing optimization fraud detection setting public policy etc these areas represent great breadth and diversity of knowledge and a data scientist will most likely be expert in only one or at most two of these areas and merely proficient in the others therefore a data scientist typically works as part of a team whose other members have knowledge and skills which complement his or hers  3  data scientists use the ability to find and interpret rich data sources manage large amounts of data despite hardware software and bandwidth constraints merge data sources ensure consistency of datasets create visualizations to aid in understanding data build mathematical models using the data and present and communicate the data insightsfindings preferably actionable insights to specialists and scientists in their team and if required to a nontechnical audience data science techniques affect research in many domains including the biological sciences  medical informatics  health care  social sciences and the humanities  it heavily influences economics  business and finance  from the business perspective data science is an integral part of competitive intelligence a newly emerging field that encompasses a number of

data science 5  conferences 6  further reading 7  references history  edit  data science process flowchart the term data science originally used interchangeably with  datalogy  has existed for over thirty years and was used initially as a substitute for computer science by peter naur in 1960 in 1974 naur published concise survey of computer methods  which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications in 1996 members of the international federation of classification societies ifcs met in kobe for their biennial conference here for the first time the term data science is included in the title of the conference data science classification and related methods  5  in november 1997 cf jeff wu gave the inaugural lecture entitled statistics  data science  6  for his appointment to the h c carver professorship at the university of michigan  7  in this lecture he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection data modeling and analysis and decision making in conclusion he coined the term data science and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists  6  later he presented his lecture entitled statistics  data science as the first of his 1998 pc mahalanobis memorial lectures  8  these lectures honor prasanta chandra mahalanobis  an indian scientist and statistician and founder of the indian statistical institute  in 2001 william s cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline extending the field of statistics to incorporate advances in computing with data in his article data science an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics which was published in volume 69 no 1 of the april 2001 edition of the international statistical review  revue internationale de statistique  9  in his report cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science multidisciplinary investigations models and methods for data computing with data pedagogy tool evaluation and theory in april 2002 the international council for science committee on data for science and technology codata  10  started the data science journal   11  a publication focused on issues such as the description of data systems their publication on the internet applications and legal issues  12  shortly thereafter in january 2003 columbia university began publishing the journal of data science   13  which provided a platform for all data workers to present their views and exchange ideas the journal was largely devoted to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research in 2005 the national science board published longlived digital data collections enabling research and education in the 21st century defining data scientists as the information and computer scientists database and software and programmers disciplinary experts curators and expert annotators librarians archivists and others who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection whose primary activity is to conduct creative inquiry and analysis  14  in 2008  citation needed   dj patil and jeff hammerbacher coined the term data scientist to define their jobs at linkedin and facebook respectively  15  domain specific interests  edit  data science is the practice of deriving valuable insights from data data science is emerging to meet the challenges of processing very large data sets ie big data consisting of structured unstructured or semistructured data that large enterprises produce a domain at center stage of data science is the explosion of new data generated from smart devices web mobile and social media data science requires a versatile skillset many practicing data scientists commonly specialize in specific domains such as the fields of marketing medical security fraud and finance however data scientists rely heavily upon elements of statistics  machine learning  optimization  signal processing  text retrieval and natural language processing to analyze data and interpret results criticism  edit  although use of the term data science has exploded in business environments many academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and statistics  writing in forbes  gil press argues that data science is a buzzword without a clear definition and has simply replaced business analytics in contexts such as graduate degree programs  16  in the questionandanswer section of his keynote address at the joint statistical meetings of american statistical association  noted applied statistician nate silver said i think datascientist is a sexed up term for a statisticianstatistics is a branch of science data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldnt berate the term statistician  17  research areas  edit  as an interdisciplinary subject data science draws scientific inquiry from a broad range of academic subject areas mostly related to the hard sciences some areas of research are cloud computing databases and information integration signal processing learning natural language processing and information extraction computer vision information retrieval and web information access knowledge discovery in social and information networks information visualization security data science  edit  data science has a long and rich history in security and fraud monitoring reference needed  security data science is focused on advancing information security through practical applications of exploratory data analysis statistics machine learning and data visualization although the tools and techniques are no different that those used in data science in any data domain this group has a microfocus on reducing risk identifying fraud or malicious insiders using data science the information security and fraud prevention industry have been evolving security data science in order to tackle the challenges of managing and gaining insights from huge streams of log data discover insider threats and prevent fraud data science companies like feedzai  18  use a mix of big data machine learning and human intelligence to identify fraudulent payment transactions security data science is data driven  meaning that new insights and value comes directly from data  19  clinical data science  edit  data science has always been prominent in the field of clinical trials  timely insight into clinical data provides answers to medical questions documenting the safety and efficacy of novel and existing therapeutic compounds with large and complex data clinical data scientists have been producing statistical analyses of clinical trials for marketing applications since clinical development has been required in the early 2000s the clinical data scientist evolved from a role of a consultant to statisticians to a strategic one now the clinical data scientist assists in the planning collection transformation analysis and reporting of clinical trial data and communication of their results these scientists are crucial to the determination of safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic compounds genomic data science  edit  application of data science does not only stop at clinical trials it was also applied to learning the proteins and dna sequences in genomics  this field because of the tools of the data scientist the work for analyzing and studying dna structures viruses and other biological pathogens handling of data is around before but using data science will make it easier for handling vast amount of data in genomics and make the procedures repeatable conferences  edit  dataedge conference data education a new generation of datasavvy professionals held by

professionals who can work effectively with data at scale is limited and is reflected by rapidly rising salaries for data engineers data scientists statisticians and data analysts a recent study by the mckinsey global institute concludes a shortage of the analytical and managerial talent necessary to make the most of big data is a significant and pressing challenge for the us the report estimates that there will be four to five million jobs in the us requiring data analysis skills by 2018 and that large numbers of positions will only be filled through training or retraining the authors also project a need for 15 million more managers and analysts with deep analytical and technical skills who can ask the right questions and consume the results of analysis of big data effectively the statistics listed below represent this significant and growing demand for data scientists 15 highest paying job in demand 3433 number of job openings 105395 average base salary 9 best job in america for 2015 sources httpwwwglassdoorcomblogjobsamerica and httpwwwglassdoorcombloghighestpayingjobsdemand an explosion of data data is increasingly cheap and ubiquitous we are now digitizing analog content that was created over centuries and collecting myriad new types of data from web logs mobile devices sensors instruments and transactions ibm estimates that 90 percent of the data in the world today has been created in the past two years at the same time new technologies are emerging to organize and make sense of this avalanche of data we can now identify patterns and regularities in data of all sorts that allow us to advance scholarship improve the human condition and create commercial and social value the rise of big data has the potential to deepen our understanding of phenomena ranging from physical and biological systems to human social and economic behavior  a challenge identified virtually every sector of the economy now has access to more data than would have been imaginable even a decade ago businesses today are accumulating new data at a rate that exceeds their capacity to extract value from it the question facing every organization that wants to attract a community is how to use data effectively  not just their own data but all of the data thats available and relevant this hot new field promises to revolutionize industries from business to government health care to academia  the new york times our ability to derive social and economic value from the newly available data is limited by the lack of expertise working with this data requires distinctive new skills and tools the corpuses are often too voluminous to fit on a single computer to manipulate with traditional databases or statistical tools or to represent using standard graphics software the data is also more heterogeneous than the highly curated data of the past digitized text audio and visual content like sensor and weblog data is typically messy incomplete and unstructured it is often of uncertain provenance and quality and frequently must be combined with other data to be useful working with usergenerated data sets also raises challenging issues of privacy security and ethics the field of data science is emerging at the intersection of the fields of social science and statistics information and computer science and design the uc berkeley school of information is ideally positioned to bring these disciplines together and to provide students with the research and professional skills to succeed in leading edge organizations learn more  there is no agreed upon definition for big data the tools of data science are as appropriate for gigabyte as they are for petabyte scale datasets big data typically refers to data on the scale of terabytes 10 to the 12th power and petabytes 10 to the 15th power a petabyte is a million gigabytes                             about  admissions  academics  blog  legal  site map

describe the exponential growth and availability of data both structured and unstructured therefore persons working on this are mostly deal with processing and analyzing massive amounts of data on the other hand  data scientists investigate complex problems through expertise in disciplines within the fields of mathematics statistics and computer science these areas represent great breadth and diversity of knowledge and a data scientist will most likely be expert in only one or at most two of these areas and merely proficient in the others 2  what programming language would be necessary the data science course is entirely taught in r software which is an open source statistical programming language and one of the essential tools that are a part of any data scientists tool kit due to its

wall street quant were the hot occupations in business today data scientists are the hires firms are competing to make as companies wrestle with unprecedented volumes and types of information demand for these experts has raced well ahead of supply indeed greylock partners the vc firm that backed facebook and linkedin is so worried about the shortage of data scientists that it has a recruiting team dedicated to channeling them to the businesses in its portfolio data scientists are the key to realizing the opportunities presented by big data they bring structure to it find compelling patterns in it and advise executives on the implications for products processes and decisions they find the story buried in the data and communicate it and they dont just deliver reports they get at the questions at the heart of problems and devise creative approaches to them one data scientist who was studying a fraud problem for example realized it was analogous to a type of dna sequencing problem bringing those disparate worlds together he crafted a solution that dramatically reduced fraud losses in this article harvard business schools davenport and greylocks patil take a deep dive on what organizations need to know about data scientists where to look for them how to attract and develop them and how to spot a great one    when jonathan goldman arrived for work in june 2006 at linkedin the business networking site the place still felt like a startup the company had just under 8 million accounts and the number was growing quickly as existing members invited their friends and colleagues to join but users werent seeking out connections with the people who were already on the site at the rate executives had expected something was apparently missing in the social experience as one linkedin manager put it it was like arriving at a conference reception and realizing you dont know anyone so you just stand in the corner sipping your drinkand you probably leave early goldman a phd in physics from stanford was intrigued by the linking he did see going on and by the richness of the user profiles it all made for messy data and unwieldy analysis but as he began exploring peoples connections he started to see possibilities he began forming theories testing hunches and finding patterns that allowed him to predict whose networks a given profile would land in he could imagine that new features capitalizing on the heuristics he was developing might provide value to users but linkedins engineering team caught up in the challenges of scaling up the site seemed uninterested some colleagues were openly dismissive of goldmans ideas why would users need linkedin to figure out their networks for them the site already had an address book importer that could pull in all a members connections luckily reid hoffman linkedins cofounder and ceo at the time now its executive chairman had faith in the power of analytics because of his experiences at paypal and he had granted goldman a high degree of autonomy for one thing he had given goldman a way to circumvent the traditional product release cycle by publishing small modules in the form of ads on the sites most popular pages through one such module goldman started to test what would happen if you presented users with names of people they hadnt yet connected with but seemed likely to knowfor example people who had shared their tenures at schools and workplaces he did this by ginning up a custom ad that displayed the three best new matches for each user based on the background entered in his or her linkedin profile within days it was obvious that something remarkable was taking place the clickthrough rate on those ads was the highest ever seen goldman continued to refine how the suggestions were generated incorporating networking ideas such as triangle closingthe notion that if you know larry and sue theres a good chance that larry and sue know each other goldman and his team also got the action required to respond to a suggestion down to one click   the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors  it didnt take long for linkedins top managers to recognize a good idea and make it a standard feature thats when things really took off people you may know ads achieved a clickthrough rate 30 higher than the rate obtained by other prompts to visit more pages on the site they generated millions of new page views thanks to this one feature linkedins growth trajectory shifted significantly upward a new breed goldman is a good example of a new key player in organizations the data scientist its a highranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data the title has been around for only a few years it was coined in 2008 by one of us dj patil and jeff hammerbacher then the respective leads of data and analytics efforts at linkedin and facebook but thousands of data scientists are already working at both startups and wellestablished companies their sudden appearance on the business scene reflects the fact that companies are now wrestling with information that comes in varieties and volumes never encountered before if your organization stores multiple petabytes of data if the information most critical to your business resides in forms other than rows and columns of numbers or if answering your biggest question would involve a mashup of several analytical efforts youve got a big data opportunity much of the current enthusiasm for big data focuses on technologies that make taming it possible including hadoop the most widely used framework for distributed file system processing and related opensource tools cloud computing and data visualization while those are important breakthroughs at least as important are the people with the skill set and the mindset to put them to good use on this front demand has raced ahead of supply indeed the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors greylock partners an earlystage venture firm that has backed companies such as facebook linkedin palo alto networks and workday is worried enough about the tight labor pool that it has built its own specialized recruiting team to channel talent to businesses in its portfolio once they have data says dan portillo who leads that team they really need people who can manage it and find insights in it who are these people if capitalizing on big data depends on hiring scarce data scientists then the challenge for managers is to learn how to identify that talent attract it to an enterprise and make it productive none of those tasks is as straightforward as it is with other established organizational roles start with the fact that there are no university programs offering degrees in data science there is also little consensus on where the role fits in an organization how data scientists can add the most value and how their performance should be measured the first step in filling the need for data scientists therefore is to understand what they do in businesses then ask what skills do they need and what fields are those skills most readily found in more than anything what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data its their preferred method of navigating the world around them at ease in the digital realm they are able to bring structure to large quantities of formless data and make analysis possible they identify rich data sources join them with other potentially incomplete data sources and clean the resulting set in a competitive landscape where challenges keep changing and data never stop flowing data scientists help decision makers shift from ad hoc analysis to an ongoing conversation with data data scientists realize that they face technical limitations but they dont allow that to bog down their search for novel solutions as they make discoveries they communicate what theyve learned and suggest its implications for new business directions often they are creative in displaying information visually and making the patterns they find clear and compelling they advise executives and product managers on the implications of the data for products processes and decisions given the nascent state of their trade it often falls to data scientists to fashion their own tools and even conduct academicstyle research yahoo one of the firms that employed a group of data scientists early on was instrumental in developing hadoop facebooks data team created the language hive for programming hadoop projects many other data scientists especially at datadriven companies such as google amazon microsoft walmart ebay linkedin and twitter have added to and refined the tool kit what kind of person does all this what abilities make a data scientist successful think of him or her as a hybrid of data hacker analyst communicator and trusted adviser the combination is extremely powerfuland rare             further reading   big data the management revolution   competitive strategy  feature    andrew mcafee and erik brynjolfsson   the challenges of becoming a big dataenabled organization require handsonor in some cases handsoffleadership      save  share    data scientists most basic universal skill is the ability to write code this may be less true in five years time when many more people will have the title data scientist on their business cards more enduring will be the need for data scientists to communicate in language that all their stakeholders understandand to demonstrate the special skills involved in storytelling with data whether verbally visually orideallyboth but we would say the dominant trait among data scientists is an intense curiositya desire to go beneath the surface of a problem find the questions at its heart and distill them into a very clear set of hypotheses that can be tested this often entails the associative thinking that characterizes the most creative scientists in any field for example we know of a data scientist studying a fraud problem who realized that it was analogous to a type of dna sequencing problem by bringing together those disparate worlds he and his team were able to craft a solution that dramatically reduced fraud losses perhaps its becoming clear why the word scientist fits this emerging role experimental physicists for example also have to design equipment gather data conduct multiple experiments and communicate their results thus companies looking for people who can work with complex data have had good luck recruiting among those with educational and work backgrounds in the physical or social sciences some of the best and brightest data scientists are phds in esoteric fields like ecology and systems biology george roumeliotis the head of a data science team at intuit in silicon valley holds a doctorate in astrophysics a little less surprisingly many of the data scientists working in business today were formally trained in computer science math or economics they can emerge from any field that has a strong data and computational focus its important to keep that image of the scientist in mindbecause the word data might easily send a search for talent down the wrong path as portillo told us the traditional backgrounds of people you saw 10 to 15 years ago just dont cut it these days a quantitative analyst can be great at analyzing data but not at subduing a mass of unstructured data and getting it into a form in which it can be analyzed a data management expert might be great at generating and organizing data in structured form but not at turning unstructured data into structured dataand also not at actually analyzing the data and while people without strong social skills might thrive in traditional data professions data scientists must have such skills to be effective  how to find the data scientists you need   1 focus recruiting at the usual suspect universities stanford mit berkeley harvard carnegie mellon and also at a few others with proven strengths north carolina state uc santa cruz the university of maryland the university of washington and ut austin  2 scan the membership rolls of user groups devoted to data science tools the r user groups for an opensource statistical tool favored by data scientists and python interest groups for piggies are good places to start  3 search for data scientists on linkedintheyre almost all on there and you can see if they have the skills you want  4 hang out with data scientists at the strata structuredata and hadoop world conferences and similar gatherings there is almost one a week now or at informal data scientist meetups in the bay area boston new york washington dc london singapore and sydney  5 make friends with a local venture capitalist who is likely to have gotten a variety of big data proposals over the past year  6 host a competition on kaggle or topcoder the analytics and coding competition sites follow up with the mostcreative entrants  7 dont bother with any candidate who cant code coding skills dont have to be at a worldclass level but should be good enough to get by look for evidence too that candidates learn rapidly about new technologies and methods  8 make sure a candidate can find a story in a data set and provide a coherent narrative about a key data insight test whether he or she can communicate with numbers visually and verbally  9 be wary of candidates who are too detached from the business world when you ask how their work might apply to your management challenges are they stuck for answers  10 ask candidates about their favorite analysis or insight and how they are keeping their skills sharp have they gotten a certificate in the advanced track of stanfords online machine learning course contributed to opensource projects or built an online repository of code to share for example on github  roumeliotis was clear with us that he doesnt hire on the basis of statistical or analytical capabilities he begins his search for data scientists by asking candidates if they can develop prototypes in a mainstream programming language such as java roumeliotis seeks both a skill seta solid foundation in math statistics probability and computer scienceand certain habits of mind he wants people with a feel for business issues and empathy for customers then he says he builds on all that with onthejob training and an occasional course in a particular technology several universities are planning to launch data science programs and existing programs in analytics such as the master of science in analytics program at north carolina state are busy adding big data exercises and coursework some companies are also trying to develop their own data scientists after acquiring the big data firm greenplum emc decided that the availability of data scientists would be a gating factor in its ownand customersexploitation of big data so its education services division launched a data science and big data analytics training and certification program emc makes the program available to both employees and customers and some of its graduates are already working on internal big data initiatives   data scientists want to build things not just give advice one describes being a consultant as the dead zone  as educational offerings proliferate the pipeline of talent should expand vendors of big data technologies are also working to make them easier to use in the meantime one data scientist has come up with a creative approach to closing the gap the insight data science fellows program a postdoctoral fellowship designed by jake klamka a highenergy physicist by training takes scientists from academia and in six weeks prepares them to succeed as data scientists the program combines mentoring by data experts from local companies such as facebook twitter google and linkedin with exposure to actual big data challenges originally aiming for 10 fellows klamka wound up accepting 30 from an applicant pool numbering more than 200 more organizations are now lining up to participate the demand from companies has been phenomenal klamka told us they just cant get this kind of highquality talent why would a data scientist want to work here even as the ranks of data scientists swell competition for top talent will remain fierce expect candidates to size up employment opportunities on the basis of how interesting the big data challenges are as one of them commented if we wanted to work with structured data wed be on wall street given that todays most qualified prospects come from nonbusiness backgrounds hiring managers may need to figure out how to paint an exciting picture of the potential for breakthroughs that their problems offer pay will of course be a factor a good data scientist will have many doors open to him or her and salaries will be bid upward several data scientists working at startups commented that theyd demanded and got large stock option packages even for someone accepting a position for other reasons compensation signals a level of respect and the value the role is expected to add to the business but our informal survey of the priorities of data scientists revealed something more fundamentally important they want to be on the bridge the reference is to the 1960s television show star trek in which the starship captain james kirk relies heavily on data supplied by mr spock data scientists want to be in the thick of a developing situation with realtime awareness of the evolving set of choices it presents considering the difficulty of finding and keeping data scientists one would think that a good strategy would involve hiring them as consultants most consulting firms have yet to assemble many of them even the largest firms such as accenture deloitte and ibm global services are in the early stages of leading big data projects for their clients the skills of the data scientists they do have on staff are mainly being applied to moreconventional quantitative analysis problems offshore analytics services firms such as mu sigma might be the ones to make the first major inroads with data scientists          but the data scientists weve spoken with say they want to build things not just give advice to a decision maker one described being a consultant as the dead zoneall you get to do is tell someone else what the analyses say they should do by creating solutions that work they can have more impact and leave their marks as pioneers of their profession care and feeding data scientists dont do well on a short leash they should have the freedom to experiment and explore possibilities that said they need close relationships with the rest of the business the most important ties for them to forge are with executives in charge of products and services rather than with people overseeing business functions as the story of jonathan goldman illustrates their greatest opportunity to add value is not in creating reports or presentations for senior executives but in innovating with customerfacing products and processes linkedin isnt the only company to use data scientists to generate ideas for products features and valueadding services at intuit data scientists are asked to develop insights for smallbusiness customers and consumers and report to a new senior vice president of big data social design and marketing ge is already using data science to optimize the service contracts and maintenance intervals for industrial products google of course uses data scientists to refine its core search and adserving algorithms zynga uses data scientists to optimize the game experience for both longterm engagement and revenue netflix created the wellknown netflix prize given to the data science team that developed the best way to improve the companys movie recommendation system the testpreparation firm kaplan uses its data scientists to uncover effective learning strategies   data scientists today are akin to the wall street quants of the 1980s and 1990s  there is however a potential downside to having people with sophisticated skills in a fastevolving field spend their time among general management colleagues theyll have less interaction with similar specialists which they need to keep their skills sharp and their tool kit stateoftheart data scientists have to connect with communities of practice either within large firms or externally new conferences and informal associations are springing up to support collaboration and technology sharing and companies should encourage scientists to become involved in them with the understanding that more water in the harbor floats all boats data scientists tend to be more motivated too when more is expected of them the challenges of accessing and structuring big data sometimes leave little time or energy for sophisticated analytics involving prediction or optimization yet if executives make it clear that simple reports are not enough data scientists will devote more effort to advanced analytics big data shouldnt equal small math the hot job of the decade hal varian the chief economist at google is known to have said the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians people think im joking but who wouldve guessed that computer engineers wouldve been the sexy job of the 1990s if sexy means having rare qualities that are much in demand data scientists are already there they are difficult and expensive to hire and given the very competitive market for their services difficult to retain there simply arent a lot of people with their combination of scientific background and computational and analytical skills data scientists today are akin to wall street quants of the 1980s and 1990s in those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies then a variety of universities developed masters programs in financial engineering which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms the pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs  one question raised by this is whether some firms would be wise to wait until that second generation of data scientists emerges and the candidates are more numerous less expensive and easier to vet and assimilate in a business setting why not leave the trouble of hunting down and domesticating exotic talent to the big data startups and to firms like ge and walmart whose aggressive strategies require them to be at the forefront the problem with that reasoning is that the advance of big data shows no signs of slowing if companies sit out this trends early days for lack of talent they risk falling behind as competitors and channel partners gain nearly unassailable advantages think of big data as an epic wave gathering now starting to crest if you want to catch it you need people who can surf   a version of this article appeared in the october 2012 issue of

aS'        data science weekly    blog  data scientist interviews  data science resources          home    data science resources    most read articles       data science most read articles  most read articles from the data science weekly newsletter by quarter   q2 2014 why becoming a data scientist is not actually easier than you think i was just doing some late night reading and came across this article tldr  you can take the ml course on coursera and youre magically a data scientist because three really intelligent people did it i disagree data scientists need their own github here are four of the best options imagine if a companys three highly valued data scientists can happily work together without duplicating each others efforts and can easily call up the ingredients and results of each others previous work that day has come getting started in data science my thoughts trey causey theres no denying that data scientist is a hot job title to have right now and for good reason its a tremendously fun and challenging field to be in and despite all of the often undeserved hoopla that surrounds it data scientists are doing some pretty amazing things so its no surprise that many people are clamoring to find out how to become data scientists as i run a blog that attempts to teach some basic data science using sports analytics i often get email asking how one gets started in data science andor how quickly one can learn the prerequisites for being a data scientist instead of replying to these all the time i thought id write my thoughts up here spark is on fire spark is on the rise to an even greater degree than i thought last month data workflows for machine learning in this indepth video we comparecontrast several open source frameworks which have emerged for machine learning workflows including knime ipython notebook and related py libraries cascading cascalog scalding summingbird sparkmlbase mbrace on net etc  elusive data scientists driving high salaries data scientists the elusive kingpins in the big data movement are earning base salaries of well over 200k are younger overwhelmingly male have at least a masters degree and probably a phd and one in three are foreign born according to the firstever study looking at salaries education levels gender and geographical location of this new profession deep learning  how  why deep learning methods work the recent resurrection of multilayer neural networks is generating a lot of interest currently with deep learning appearing on the new york times front page and big companies like google and facebook hunting for the experts in this field jurgens talk sheds more light on how deep learning methods work and why they work why the r programming language is good for business thanks to one company the same code that is revolutionizing the scientific community is now moving up the ranks of the business world what is the difference between artificial intelligence machine learning statistics and data mining i assume the author of that question is trying to get a clear picture by understanding the line of separation that distinguish each field from the other so here is my take to explain it in a more simplified way that i ever could do meta what data scientists are reading and why we recently posted an analysis of the mostread articles on this newsletter for the past two quarters we were curious to understand what was getting the most clicks and if there were any consistent areas of interest          sign up to receive the data science weekly newsletter every thursday            easy

learning concepts below is a list i find most illuminating the 30hr data scientist yesterday a journalist asked me to comment on vincent granvilles post about the 30hr data scientist for hire on elance what started as a quick reply in an email spiraled a bit so i figured id post the entire reply here to get your thoughts in the comments how do i become a data scientist i got an email recently asking something along these lines im a smart exengineer who likes stats i want to be a data scientist how difficult will it be for me to find a job doing data science work at a startup i sent back an email which looked more or less like the following post 10 surprising machine learning applications you may have heard that todays tech companies are using machine learning to identify and filter email spam google blacklist and penalize spam blogs so that users get good search results also google recommend products specifically for you amazon and fight fraud ibm todays post isnt about that its about the new perhaps surprising ways that companies and nonprofits are using machine learning to make smarter faster better products how i made 500k with machine learning and high frequency trading this post will detail what i did to make approx 500k from high frequency trading from 2009 to 2010 since i was trading completely independently and am no longer running my program im happy to tell all my trading was mostly in russel 2000 and dax futures contracts a noncomprehensive list of awesome things other people did this year i made this list off the top of my head and have surely missed awesome things people have done this year i wrote this post because a blog often feels like a place to complain but we started simply stats as a place to be pumped up about the stuff people were doing with data how to speed up a python program 114000 times optimizations are one thing  making a serious data collection program run 114000 times faster is another thing entirely leaning on 30 years of programming experience david schachter goes over all the optimizations he made to his secret companys datacollecting program to get such massive performance gains in doing so he might be able to teach you a thing or two about optimizing a python program flappy bird hack using reinforcement learning this is a hack for the popular game flappy bird after playing the game a few times i saw the opportunity to practice my machine learning skills and try and get flappy bird to learn how to play the game by itself is julia the future for big data analytics in many big data blogs meetups and in the halls of the most recent oreilly strata conference one of the mostdiscussed topics is which language is better for data analysis python or r some of the talk has even reached religious overtones not unlike previous discussions on windows vs linux or microsofts internet explorer vs mozilla firefox so whats the issue here difference between data scientist and data analyst jobs related to data science have topped the charts in job portals there are job openings for various job titles like data scientists data analysts and data engineers though all these job titles deal with data and sound similar they do have a number of detailed differences ever wondered how different they are from each other i did and here are the differences i found between a data scientist and a data analyst

language of choice for data science nowadays python is probably the programming language of choice besides r for data scientists for prototyping visualization and running data analyses on small and medium sized data sets and rightly so i think given the large number of available tools however it wasnt always like this stanford algorithm analyzes sentence sentiment advances machine learning the program dubbed nasent  short for neural analysis of sentiment  is a new development in a field of computer science known as deep learning that aims to give computers the ability to acquire new understandings in a more humanlike way how to find the bars that women love jetpac city guides tells you all about the best places in every city to hit based on analyzing millions of instagram photos it uses some pretty cool big data technology to look at the photos understand whats going on in them are people smiling what are they wearing and match them to their gps locations scryer netflixs predictive auto scaling engine  part 2 in part 1 of this series we introduced scryer netflixs predictive autoscaling engine and discussed its use cases and how it runs in netflix in this second installment we will discuss the design of scryer ranging from the technical implementation to the algorithms that drive its predictions you might be a data scientist if as i meet upandcoming data scientists ive realized that we share a surprising number of very specific experiences heres a list of things of these data science rites of passage in no particular order this data scientist spent a year deep inside the new york times heres what he discovered brian abelson spent the last year at the times using data and analytics to understand times content abelson had access to one of the most coveted datasets in publishing the new york times web and social trafficwe talk to abelson about his year at the times as he attempted to create a better set of metrics focused on measurements of human response to media like impact and behavioral change ubers data scientist on the importance of knowing one thing about everybody data scientist bradley voytek recently spoke about his work at car service uber he explained how user information with location and temporal data could be analyzed to find unexpected and useful correlations what i learnt from 2 years of data sciencing last week was my last day at uswitchcom from becoming aware of data scientist as a valid job title on my job offer letter to speaking at strata london to signing a book deal to write about it in our book on web data mining thats progressing at a glacial pace i figured that i should jot down some takeaway lessons while this experience is still fresh new to data science get started on the path toward becoming a data science practitioner with this helpful list of resources online learning curriculum for data scientists is there any online reading or courses i can do to get into data analysis i get asked this question a lot in the workplace in this post i propose a learning path to get into data analysis          sign up to receive the data science weekly newsletter every thursday            easy to
