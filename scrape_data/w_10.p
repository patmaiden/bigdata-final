all my reviews    one word sums up how i felt while watching w uncomfortable i went into this film expecting more of an absurdist comedy than a tragedy the level of realism was far beyond what i expected for the most part the cast makeup and casting crew did such a good job with the characters that it was very easy to imagine that these were not actors on the screen but the actual people josh brolins characterization of w was certainly oscarworthy even better than brolins part was phedon papamichaels photographic direction the job of the director of photography is to bring the story to life through the creation of images to draw the attention of the viewer where the director wants few films are as good of an example of this as w papamichael used the camera to force moral and emotional perspective in a way that i have rarely seen outside of the films of stanley kubrick ive only seen the film once viewing it as a complete work i intend to watch it again to study the photography overall i thought the film was fair in its treatment of the actual people involved the most ardent bush supporters will not like it but to still be that supportive of him in the final months of his second term you either have to not be paying attention or be uncritical in all of your thought while artistic license was taken throughout the film the portrayal of all events and people with the possible exception of dick cheney were far more grounded in reality and recorded history than i expected the film made me uncomfortable on multiple levels which is why it succeeds and deserves such a high rating the portrayal of bushs relationship with his parents especially his father forces the viewer to feel sorry for him the overt religiosity that pervades the public service portion of his life must anger anyone who believes strongly in the separation of church and state there are many moments when with any other characters the film should have generated much laughter only one moment in the film actually caused more than one person in the theater to laugh i guess 4000 dead soldiers drains the humor out of even the most hilarious gaffes i would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a realistic portrayal of historical events i wish stone had waited until bush was out of office to make it though while it captures the major events that were involved in building the bush legacy it ends far too early     104 of 166 people found this review helpful                     was this review helpful to you yes  no    review this title    see all 312 user

he will run for congress in texas at a barbecue bush meets his future wife laura lane welch  elizabeth banks  during his congressional debate bush is criticized by his democratic opponent kent hance  paul rae  who says that bush is not a real texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcoholfueled party for underage texas tech university students bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election but with the highest number of votes for a republican candidate in the states history angered by his loss bush declares that he will never be outtexasd or outchristianed again in 1986 bush becomes a bornagain christian  gives up alcohol and somewhat mends his relationship with his father the elder bush invites him to assist with what becomes his successful 1988 presidential campaign  although bush himself suspects that he only was asked because jeb was busy bushs political advisor karl rove  toby jones  tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself but has not yet done anything with his life bush becomes a front office executive of the texas rangers baseball team  while his father oversees the victory of the persian gulf war  although allied forces

decision not to depose saddam in 1994 bush decides to run for governor of texas despite his fathers opposition in 1999 he makes a successful bid to become president  following the september 11 attacks in 2001 bush labels three of americas enemies  specifically iran  iraq and north korea as the  axis of evil  in 2002 bush begins searching for evidence that saddam was creating nuclear weapons  and has the army prepared all of bushs white house staff supports him except secretary of state colin powell  jeffrey wright  who states that planning to invade iraq would destabilize the country powell is generally overruled by vice president  dick cheney  richard dreyfuss  and secretary of defense  donald rumsfeld  scott glenn  who insist that the war  deliberately waged without an exit strategy would secure the united states status as sole global superpower while spreading democracy throughout the middle east in his state of the union address in 2003 bush states that either youre with us or youre with the terrorists in march of that year the us invades iraq and at first the war appears to be a success and bush gives his infamous  mission accomplished  speech on an aircraft carrier when it becomes clear that there are no weapons of mass destruction within iraq  bush learns that the responsibility for finding them had been relegated far down the chain of command bush also discovers that saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that bush was bluffing bush is asked in a white house press conference what mistakes he made as president a question that leaves him flustered and speechless that night bush has a nightmare in which his father accuses him of ruining his familys legacy which the elder bush claims was intended for jeb in the final scene of the film bush dreams of playing center field at a baseball game bush attempts to catch a pop fly  but it quickly disappears cast  edit  josh brolin as george w bush  stones original idea for the main role was to propose it to harrison ford  who he said had a pretty similar face as of george bush stone then cast christian bale  who spent months researching for the role but dropped out after he was not satisfied with the prosthetic makeup tests stone remarked christians a very methodical actor and he has to have the makeup thing work for him  3  brolin cast at the last minute  3  spent months working on bushs distinctive vocal style calling hotels in texas and talking to the people at the front desk listening to their accents the actor also watched videos of bush walking brolin said it changes over the years how he walks in his 30s how he walks in foreign lands before 911 and afterward people hold their emotions in their bodies they cant fake it especially him  4  elizabeth banks as laura bush  banks said she would not do an impression of the first lady i just want to honor her voice her stillness and her hairstyle  4  james cromwell as george h w bush  bushs father and the 41st president of the united states ellen burstyn as barbara bush richard dreyfuss as dick cheney  stone was interested in robert duvall as cheney but duvall turned down the role  5  dreyfuss and stone did not get along well during filming and dreyfuss was harshly critical of the director during the films press junket noting stone had attacked him right before that tour began dreyfuss also told nathan rabin in an interview that he did not empathize with the former vice president calling him true to himself and saying that the real villain of w was the american public because it never responded with outrage to the bush administrations actions jeffrey wright as us secretary of state gen colin powell scott glenn as us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld thandie newton as us national security advisor  condoleezza rice toby jones as deputy white house chief of staff karl rove bruce mcgill as central intelligence agency director george tenet ioan gruffudd as british prime minister tony blair  much of gruffudds intended scene was cut the scene depicted blair revealing his intentions to convert to catholicism and his desire to give the united nations and british and us allies more time and greater involvement before the iraq invasion noah wyle as us secretary of commerce donald evans rob corddry as white house press secretary ari fleischer dennis boutsikaris as us deputy secretary of

pressly as anchorwoman sayed badreya as saddam hussein  president of iraq william chan as hospital doctor teresa cheung as miss china colin hanks as david frum bryan massey as skeeter brent sexton as joe oneill randal reeder as oil rig foreman production  edit  i want a fair true portrait of the man how did bush go from an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world its like frank capra territory on one hand but ill also cover the demons in his private life his bouts with his dad and his conversion to christianity which explains a lot of where he is coming from it includes his belief that god personally chose him to be president of the united states and his coming into his own with the stunning preemptive attack on iraq it will contain surprises for bush supporters and his detractors oliver stone  8  w was oliver stones third film in a trilogy he made about the presidency set in the time from the 1960s to today the set began with jfk and continued with nixon  originally he was attached to direct pinkville  a film about the army s investigation of the my lai massacre  but development was canceled due to the 20072008 writers guild of america strike and actor bruce willis pulling out of the film three weeks before shooting was set to start  4  as a result united artists shut the production down stone moved on to direct a film about the life and presidency of george w bush  shopping a script that had been written before the strike by stanley weiser who had cowritten wall street with stone weiser and stone read 17 books as part of their research for the script  9  and worked on the project for a year before venturing to film pinkville   8  stone has admitted that he and weiser had to speculate on some dialogue you take all the facts and take the spirit of the scene and make it accurate to what you think happened  10   w was financed independently for stone with hong kong german and australian funds he tried to approach american studios for money but got turned down  11   lions gate entertainment distributed the film  4  though stone has criticized bush for his administrations 2003 invasion of iraq  the director said that he was not looking to make an antibush polemic  stone compared his goal of the film to that of the queen  wanting to trace seminal events in bushs life according to the director its a behindthescenes approach similar to nixon  to give a sense of what its like to be in his skin but if nixon was a symphony  this is more like a chamber piece  and not as dark in tone  8  he described the structure of w as a threeact film starting with bush as a young man with a missed life followed by his transformation and an assertion of will which was amazingly powerful as he came out from his fathers shadow and finally his invasion of iraq  12  the film originally titled bush   8  was retitled w  13  filming began on may 12 2008 in shreveport louisiana   14  and completed filming on july 11 2008  15  on may 13 2008 the new york post published excerpts from an early draft of the script the column written by cindy adams  stated probushies will hate it antis will love it  16  the film was released on october 17 2008 timed just before the presidential election   2   w s producers reportedly ran television spots for the film opposite republican party  presidential nominee  john mccain s ads in the fall of 2008  4  reception  edit  critical response  edit  w received mixed to positive reviews from critics as of december 18 2014 rotten tomatoes reports 59 of critics giving the film positive writeups based upon a sample of 212 with an average score of 610 compared to audiences giving a 42 positive review 35 based on 109205 ratings  17  the website summarized the reviews of the film by calling it a surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of the 43rd american president w is fascinating in spots but merely rudimentary as a whole  17  at metacritic  which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the film has received an average score of 56 based on 36 reviews  18  giving the film four stars in his review roger ebert wrote that it was fascinating and praised all the actors noting that richard dreyfuss in particular was not so much a double as an embodiment of dick cheney  19  in contrast ann hornaday of the washington post called the film a rushed wildly uneven tonally jumbled caricature  20  film critic james berardinelli negatively compared the film with saturday night live skits saying of the actors that none of them are as deadon as tina fey as sarah palin  the bush administration never officially commented on the film former florida governor  jeb bush  who is portrayed in the film called the sibling rivalry portrayed in the film highgrade unadulterated hooey and said that stones exploration of the family dynamic could have benefited from actual conversations with the bush family   21   slate magazine s timothy noah  however noted that most of the films more ludicrous details are actually directly taken from nonfiction sources and argued that the film was too kind to bush in omitting certain historically recorded dramatic events most notably bushs alleged mocking of murderer karla faye tucker  a woman put to death during his tenure of the texan governorship  22  however the incident is disputed by bush himself and as such is also unconfirmed in a march 2010 screen test interview with the new york times  lynne hirschberg josh brolin claims bush did in fact watch the film brolin said oliver stone met with bill clinton in china and clinton told stone hed lent his copy of w to bush reportedly bush himself liked it very much and thought there were sad moments  23  the film appeared on some critics top ten lists of the best films of 2008 joe neumaier of the new york daily news named it the eighth best film of 2008  24  and roger ebert of the chicago suntimes named it on his top 20 list he did not assign rankings  24  box office  edit  the film opened no 4 behind the secret life of bees  beverly hills chihuahua  and max payne  respectively with 10505668 from 2030 theaters with a 5175 average  25  the

hall of fame top 50 reviewer vine voice on october 20 2008 format dvd  to be honest i am a liberal who went to this movie expecting to see a funny parody of george w bush along the lines of a michael moore film  while i did laugh at times during the film i left the movie feeling strangely sympathetic towards poor w  stone plays it surprisingly straight presenting bush as the kid who had trouble finding his way as a grownup  the main focus here is on bushs relationship with his father particularly his efforts to constantly try to please george the elder and falling short especially when compared with his brother jeb  stone effectively weaves in flashblacks from bushs college and early adult years with his first term as president  some major events including the 2000 election and september 11th are given almost no attention but again thats not the main focus of the film the movie is superbly cast  josh brolin does an amazing job as w he manages to capture bushs mannerisms in a portrayal that is uncannily accurate without becoming a caricature  then theres james cromwell who looks and sounds nothing like george bush senior but somehow manages to depict the former president perfectly just the same  most of the other supporting roles are excellent as well from richard dreyfuss as cheney to jeffrey wright as colin powell the one exception was thandie newtons condoleezza rice who did feel more like a caricature no matter which side of the aisle you find yourself on this is an engrossing movie with the potential to appeal to many different types of people and i definitely recommend it   27 comments   was this review helpful to you   yes no    sending feedback  thank you for your feedback if this review is inappropriate please let us know    sorry we failed

stones w is one of the years most absorbing films and thats because as the tagline suggests it reveals that george w bush has been greatly misunderestimated watching this film we see not the fortythird president of the united states the former governor of texas or even a politician in general from my perspective were being told about an insecure man who reaches too far in an attempt to earn his fathers approval this movie is not a political commentaryits a character study better still its a character study thats more or less historically accurate with stone and writer stanley weisner relying on published works and indepth reports for the screenplay liberties were obviously taken after all theres no way anyone could know exactly what was said behind closed doors but all the basic scenarios are well documented which is to say that the film never once felt contrived the end result is a compelling complex and occasionally funny examination of a person who always has something to prove josh brolin is perfectly cast as the title character flawlessly capturing the mannerisms and diction weve become so familiar with over the last eight years we see him as a determined but incompetent man who claws his way up to the presidency without the necessary skills pay close attention to scenes featuring w in staff meetings it quickly becomes clear that political heavyweights like dick cheney richard dreyfuss karl rove toby jones condoleeza rice thandie newton colin powell jeffrey wright and even the infuriated donald rumsfeld scott glenn are making all the important decisions as for w well let us not forget that the real president bush publicly declared that his faith in god influenced his foreign policy decisions read more   29 comments   was this

people found the following review helpful operates under the bush is an idiot pretense but still a possible scenario   by  zachary koenig  on september 9 2009 format dvd   when making a semibiographical film there really are two ways that one can go about the task  the first method would be to try to be as objective as possible in trying to present all sides of a persons life and public reception equally  sadly that method was most definitely not used by oliver stone in the making of w upon just a surfacelevel viewing of the film one might think that objectivitywise it isnt really too bad  george w bush is portrayed both at his worst the college years and at his best the 911 response including pretty much all his important life events in between  yet for viewers who did not feel that mr bush was the root of all political evil while in office they will be able to see the framework from which stone is portraying our latest departed president basically the 1 problem inherent in w is that it clearly takes the stance that bush is an idiot no matter what the time period situation or office he holds  for example instead of the strong leadership ability that was the bush administrations claim to fame stone projects gw as a stupid bumbling idiot who was nothing more than a puppet of a few of his more superior cabinet members such as vice president dick cheney  then there is also stones take on george w bush becoming a bornagain christian  instead of perhaps even hinting at the fact that bush might have made a sincere and heartfelt transformation towards god stone portrays the revelation as just emboldening bush to keep blundering through life as now he supposedly has god to back him up unfortunately those two examples do not stand alonethe entire film is just dripping with the idiot bush mentality read more   2 comments   was this review helpful to you   yes no    sending feedback  thank you for your feedback if this review is inappropriate please let
