external links food sources global average daily calorie consumption in 1995 most food has its origin in plants some food is obtained directly from plants but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop maize  wheat  and rice in all of their varieties  account for 87 of all grain production worldwide  2  most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi  especially mushrooms  fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened  bread  alcoholic drinks  cheese  pickles  kombucha  and yogurt  another example is bluegreen algae such as spirulina   3  inorganic substances such as salt  baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient plants see also herb and spice many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2000 plant species which are cultivated for food many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars   4  seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals including humans because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plants initial growth including many healthful fats such as omega fats  in fact the majority of food consumed by human beings are seedbased foods edible seeds include cereals  maize  wheat  rice  et cetera  legumes  beans  peas  lentils  et cetera  and nuts  oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils  sunflower  flaxseed  rapeseed including canola oil  sesame  et cetera   5  seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and in moderation are considered a health food  although not all seeds are edible large seeds such as those from a lemon  pose a choking hazard while seeds from cherries and apples contain cyanide which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes  6  fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants including the seeds within many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter because animals that eat the fruits may excrete the seeds some distance away fruits therefore make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures some botanical fruits such as tomatoes  pumpkins  and eggplants  are eaten as vegetables  7  for more information see list of fruits  vegetables are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food these include root vegetables  potatoes and carrots  bulbs  onion family leaf vegetables  spinach and lettuce  stem vegetables  bamboo shoots and asparagus  and inflorescence vegetables  globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower   8  animals main articles animal source foods and food chain animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce meat is an example of a direct product taken from an animal which comes from muscle systems or from organs  various raw meats food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands  which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products cheese butter  etc in addition birds and other animals lay eggs  which are often eaten and bees produce honey  a reduced nectar from flowers which is a popular sweetener in many cultures some cultures consume blood  sometimes in the form of blood sausage  as a thickener for sauces or in a cured  salted form for times of food scarcity and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare   9  some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural dietary health ethical or ideological reasons vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees vegans do not consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source production tractor and chaser bin main articles agriculture  food industry and genetically modified food most food has always been obtained through agriculture  with increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern industrial agriculture  there has been a growing trend toward sustainable agricultural practices this approach partly fueled by consumer demand encourages biodiversity  local selfreliance and organic farming methods  10  major influences on food production include international organizations eg the world trade organization and common agricultural policy  national government policy or law and war  11  in popular culture the mass production of food specifically meats such as chicken and beef  has come under fire from various documentaries  most recently food inc  documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals often for easier revenues from large corporations  along with a current trend towards environmentalism  people in western culture have had an increasing trend towards the use of herbal supplements  foods for a specific group of person such as dieters women or athletes functional foods fortified foods such as omega3 eggs and a more ethnically diverse diet  12  several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which agroecosystems provide food but also support vital ecosystem services so that soil fertility and biodiversity are maintained rather than compromised according to the international water management institute and unep  wellmanaged agroecosystems not only provide food fiber and animal products they also provide services such as flood mitigation  groundwater recharge  erosion control and habitats for plants birds fish and other animals  13  taste perception main article taste animals specifically humans have five different types of tastes sweet  sour  salty  bitter  and umami  as animals have evolved  the tastes that provide the most energy  sugar and fats  are the most pleasant to eat while others such as bitter  are not enjoyable  14  water while important for survival has no taste  15  fats on the other hand especially saturated fats  are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat sweet structure of sucrose generally regarded as the most pleasant taste sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose  or disaccharides such as sucrose  a molecule combining glucose and fructose  16  complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the sugar molecule creating the sensation of sweet without the calories other types of sugar include raw sugar  which is known for its amber color as it is unprocessed as sugar is vital for energy and survival the taste of sugar is pleasant the stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which when extracted has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar  17  sour sourness is caused by the taste of acids  such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages sour foods include citrus  specifically lemons  limes  and to a lesser degree oranges  sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria  18  many foods however are slightly acidic and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor salty salt mounds in bolivia  saltiness is the taste of alkali metal  ions such as sodium and potassium  it is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant there are many different types of salt with each having a different degree of saltiness including sea salt  fleur de sel  kosher salt  mined salt and grey salt other than enhancing flavor its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance which is the kidney s function salt may be iodized meaning iodine has been added to it a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function some canned foods notably soups or packaged broths  tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion similarly dried foods also promote food safety  19  bitter bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp pungent taste dark unsweetened chocolate  caffeine  lemon rind and some types of fruit are known to be bitter umami also named savoury umami  the japanese word for delicious is the least known in western popular culture but has a long tradition in asian cuisine umami is the taste of glutamates  especially monosodium glutamate msg  16  it is characterized as savory meaty and rich in flavor salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami cuisine main articles cuisine  regional cuisine and global cuisines many cultures have a recognizable cuisine a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture which evolves over time other differences include preferences hot or cold spicy etc and practices the study of which is known as gastronomy  many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation cooking methods and manufacturing this also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food not just by consumption some popular types of ethnic foods include italian  french  japanese  chinese  american  cajun  thai  african and indian cuisine   citation needed  various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits  while evolutionarily speaking as opposed to culturally humans are omnivores  religion and social constructs such as morality  activism  or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste  the perception of flavor from eating and drinking certain tastes are more enjoyable than others for evolutionary purposes presentation a french basil salmon terrine  with eyeappealing garnishes main article food presentation aesthetically pleasing and eyeappealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods a common saying is that people eat with their eyes food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor even if unsatisfactory  20   21  contrast in texture texture plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods contrasts in textures such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish may increase the appeal of eating it common examples include adding granola to yogurt  adding croutons to a salad or soup  and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping such as jam or butter  22  contrast in taste another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation for example such opposite flavors as sweetness and saltiness tend to go well together as in kettle corn and nuts  food preparation main article outline of food preparation while many foods can be eaten raw many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety palatability  texture  or flavor  at the simplest level this may involve washing cutting trimming or adding other foods or ingredients such as spices it may also involve mixing heating or cooling pressure cooking  fermentation or combination with other food in a home most food preparation takes place in a kitchen  some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal other preparation may help to preserve the food others may be involved in cultural identity a meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place  23  a refrigerator helps to keep foods fresh animal preparation the preparation of animalbased food usually involves slaughter  evisceration  hanging portioning and rendering  in developed countries this is usually done outside the home in slaughterhouses  which are used to process animals en masse for meat production many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law for example the united states has established the humane slaughter act of 1958 which requires that an animal be stunned before killing this act like those in many countries exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law such as kosher  shechita  and dhabiha halal strict interpretations of kashrut require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut  24  on the local level a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts and prewrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper in addition fish and seafood may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger however fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quickfrozen for preservation of quality  25  cooking cooking with a wok in china main article cooking the term cooking encompasses a vast range of methods tools and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food cooking technique known as culinary art  generally requires the selection measurement and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result constraints on success include the variability of ingredients ambient conditions tools  and the skill of the individual cook  26  the diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional aesthetic agricultural economic cultural and religious considerations that affect it  27  cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually though not always chemically changes the molecules thus changing its flavor texture  appearance and nutritional properties  28  cooking certain proteins such as egg whites meats and fish denatures the protein causing it to firm there is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at homo erectus campsites dating from 420000 years ago  29  boiling as a means of cooking requires a container and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium bc with the introduction of pottery   30  cooking equipment a stainless steel  frying pan a traditional asado barbecue main article cookware and bakeware there are many different types of equipment used for cooking ovens are mostly hollow devices that get very hot up to 500 f and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dryheat cooking method different cuisines will use different types of ovens for example indian culture uses a tandoor oven which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature  31  western kitchens use variable temperature convection ovens  conventional ovens toaster ovens  or nonradiant heat ovens like the microwave oven  classic italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood ovens may be woodfired coalfired gas  electric or oilfired  32  various types of cooktops are used as well they carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above cooktops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source such as a saute pan  sauce pot frying pan  or pressure cooker  these pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming  simmering  boiling  and poaching for moist methods while the dry methods include sauteing  pan frying  and deepfrying   33  in addition many cultures use grills for cooking a grill operates with a radiant heat source from below usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover an open pit barbecue in the american south is one example along with the american style outdoor grill fueled by wood liquid propane or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking  34  a mexican style of barbecue is called barbacoa  which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire in argentina  an asado spanish for grilled is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled  35  raw food preparation many types of fish ready to be eaten including salmon and tuna  main article raw foodism certain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in their raw state salads consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines sashimi in japanese cuisine consists of raw sliced fish or other meat and sushi often incorporates raw fish or seafood steak tartare and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon mixed with various ingredients and served with baguettes  brioche  or frites   36  in italy carpaccio is a dish of very thinly sliced raw beef  drizzled with a vinaigrette made with olive oil  37  the health food movement known as raw foodism promotes a mostly vegan diet of raw fruits vegetables and grains prepared in various ways including juicing food dehydration sprouting and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above 118 f 478 c  38  an example of a raw meat dish is ceviche  a latin american dish made with raw meat that is cooked from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic restaurants allyn house restaurant menu march 5 1859 mcdonalds restaurant riyadh saudi arabia toms restaurant  a restaurant in new york city main article restaurant restaurants employ trained chefs who prepare food and trained waitstaff to serve the customers the term restaurant is credited to the french from the 19th century as it relates to the restorative nature of the bouillons that were once served in them however the concept predates the naming of these establishments as evidence suggests commercial food preparation may have existed during the age of the city of pompeii  and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in china during the song dynasty  the coffee shops or cafes of 17th century europe may also be considered an early version of the restaurant  39  in 2005 the population of the united states spent 496 billion for outofhome dining  expenditures by type of outofhome dining were as follows 40 in fullservice restaurants 372 in limited service restaurants  fast food  66 in schools or colleges 54 in bars and vending machines  47 in hotels and motels 40 in recreational places and 22 in others which includes military bases  40  food manufacturing packaged household food items main article food manufacture packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase this can be as simple as a butcher preparing meat or as complex as a modern international food industry  early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation packaging and transportation this mainly involved salting  curing  curdling drying  pickling  fermenting  and smoking   41  food manufacturing arose during the industrial revolution in the 19th century  42  this development took advantage of new mass markets and emerging new technology such as milling  preservation packaging and labeling  and transportation it brought the advantages of preprepared timesaving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants  43  at the start of the 21st century a twotier structure has arisen with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of wellknown food brands  there also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies  44  advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture computerbased control systems sophisticated processing and packaging methods and logistics and distribution advances can enhance product quality improve food safety  and reduce costs  43  commercial trade food imports in 2005 international food imports and exports the world bank reported that the european union was the top food importer in 2005 followed at a distance by the usa and japan britain s need for food was especially well illustrated in world war ii  despite the implementation of food rationing  britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the battle of the atlantic  food is traded and marketed on a global basis the variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season  45  between 1961 and 1999 there was a 400 increase in worldwide food exports  46  some countries are now economically dependent on food exports which in some cases account for over 80 of all exports  47  in 1994 over 100 countries became signatories to the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in a dramatic increase in trade liberalization  this included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers underpinned by the wto enforcement of agricultural subsidy  tariffs  import quotas  and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved  48  where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety the wto refer the dispute to the codex alimentarius commission which was founded in 1962 by the united nations  food and agriculture organization and the world health organization trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade  49  see also population density marketing and retailing packaged food aisles of supermarket in portland oregon  united states of america main article food marketing food marketing brings together the producer and the consumer it is the chain of activities that brings food from farm gate to plate  50  the marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies for example fiftysix companies are involved in making one can of chicken noodle soup these businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans  51  the food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect nongovernment employer in the united states in the premodern era the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers  27   43  with the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations typically early grocery shops would be counterbased shops in which purchasers told the shopkeeper what they wanted so that the shopkeeper could get it for them  27   52  in the 20th century supermarkets were born supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping using shopping carts  and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced staffing costs in the latter part of the 20th century this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehousesized outoftown supermarkets selling a wide range of food from around the world  53  unlike food processors food retailing is a twotier market in which a small number of very large companies control a large proportion of supermarkets the supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors and strong influence over consumers nevertheless less than 10 of consumer spending on food goes to farmers with larger percentages going to advertising  transportation and intermediate corporations  54  prices some essential food products including bread  rice and pasta main articles 20072008 world food price crisis and food vs fuel it was reported on march 24 2008 that consumers worldwide faced rising food prices  55  reasons for this development include changes in the weather and dramatic changes in the global economy  including higher oil prices  lower food reserves and growing consumer demand in china and india   55  in the long term prices are expected to stabilize  55  farmers will grow more grain for both fuel and food and eventually bring prices down  55  already this is happening with wheat   56   57  with more crops to be planted in the united states  canada  and europe in 2009 however the food and agriculture organization projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018  55  food meat dairy cereals vegetable oil and sugar price indices deflated using the world bank manufactures unit value index muv  58  it is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once food prices rose 4 in the united states in 2007 the highest increase since 1990 and are expected to climb as much again in 2008 as of december 2007 37 countries faced food crises and 20 had imposed some sort of foodprice controls in china the price of pork jumped 58 in 2007 in the 1980s and 1990s farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down however new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983  55  food prices are rising wealthier asian consumers are westernizing their diets and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace the past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry which in 2008 accounted for more than 30 of production while china alone accounts for more than 10 of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry the trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing as well as global cocoa chocolate and sugar confectionery manufacturing forecast to grow by 57 and 100 respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in chinese and southeast asian markets  59  rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world including rioting in bangladesh and mexico   60  and the arab spring   citation needed  in 2013 overseas development institute researchers showed that rice has more than doubled in price since 2000 rising by 120 in real terms this was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers more fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser diesel and labour parts of asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 13 billion 2008 estimate of asias poor in reducing the poverty they face however this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who dont share in the economic boom especially in asian and african coastal cities the researchers said the threat means socialprotection policies are needed to guard against price shocks the research proposed that in the longer run the rises present opportunities to export for western african farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production  61  as investment institutions such as hedge funds  pension funds and investment banks like barclays capital  goldman sachs and morgan stanley  60  have been instrumental in pushing up prices in the last five years with investment in food commodities rising from 65bn to 126bn 41bn to 79bn between 2007 and 2012 contributing to 30year highs this has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food according to the united nations  60  financial institutions now make up 61 of all investment in wheat futures according to olivier de schutter  the un special rapporteur on food there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following george w bush s commodities futures modernization act of 2000  60  de schutter told the independent in march 2012 what we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors who are purely interested in the shortterm monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing  they never actually buy the ton of wheat or maize  they only buy a promise to buy or to sell the result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic this explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand  60  in 2011 450 economists from around the world called on the g20 to regulate the commodities market more  60  some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors such as climate change  competition with biofuels and overall rising demand  60  however some such as jayati ghosh  professor of economics at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi  have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues ghosh points to world wheat prices which doubled in the period from june to december 2010 despite there being no fall in global supply  60  famine and hunger food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation  this is often connected with famine  which involves the absence of food in entire communities this can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage most notably during times of war  11  starvation is a significant international problem approximately 815 million people are undernourished and over 16000 children die per day from hungerrelated causes  62  food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in maslows hierarchy of needs and is measured using famine scales   63  food aid main article food aid food aid can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food it can be used to improve peoples lives in the short term so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required  64  conversely badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets depressing crop prices and discouraging food production sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop  65  its provision or threatened withdrawal is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country a strategy known as food politics  sometimes food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries  66  international efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the world food programme   67  safety main article food safety salmonella bacteria is a common cause of foodborne illness particularly in undercooked chicken and chicken eggs hazard analysis and critical control points  haccp  flowchart foodborne illness  commonly called food poisoning is caused by bacteria  toxins  viruses  parasites  and prions  roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year with about 10 times as many suffering from a nonfatal version  68  the two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are crosscontamination of readytoeat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control less commonly acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs for example from improper storage or use of nonfood grade soaps and disinfectants food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles known as foreign bodies during farming manufacture cooking packaging distribution or sale these foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings hairs cigarette butts wood chips and all manner of other contaminants it is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container such as a ceramic pot with leadbased glaze  68  food poisoning has been recognized as a disease since as early as hippocrates  69  the sale of rancid  contaminated or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of hygiene  refrigeration and vermin controls in the 19th century discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat and other microbiological studies by scientists such as louis pasteur  contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today this was further underpinned by the work of justus von liebig  which led to the development of modern food storage and food preservation methods  70  in more recent years a greater understanding of the causes of foodborne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the hazard analysis and critical control points  haccp  which can identify and eliminate many risks  71  recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate ensuring an adequate cooking temperature and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking  72  foods that spoil easily such as meats  dairy  and seafood  must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared as such the general rule of thumb is that cold foods such as dairy products should be kept cold and hot foods such as soup should be kept hot until storage cold meats such as chicken that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth such as salmonella or e coli   73  allergies main article food allergy some people have allergies or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people this occurs when a persons immune system mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it about 2 of adults and 8 of children have a food allergy  74  the amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small in some instances traces of food in the air too minute to be perceived through smell have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals common food allergens are gluten  corn  shellfish mollusks peanuts  and soy   74  allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea  rashes  bloating vomiting  and regurgitation  the digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen   74  rarely food allergies can lead to a medical emergency  such as anaphylactic shock  hypotension low blood pressure and loss of consciousness an allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut although latex products can induce similar reactions  74  initial treatment is with epinephrine adrenaline often carried by known patients in the form of an epipen or twinject   75   76  other health issues human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35 of cancers in a human epidemiological analysis by richard doll and richard peto in 1981  77  these cancer may be caused by carcinogens that are present in food naturally or as contaminants food contaminated with fungal growth may contain mycotoxins such as aflatoxins which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts other carcinogens identified in food include heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature polyaromatic hydrocarbons in charred meat and smoked fish and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon   78  anticarcinogens that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruits and vegetable antioxidants are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals it is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food such as beef steak and broccoli contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens  78  diet changes of food supply by energy  79   80  other area yr 2010  81   africa subsahara  2170

main article diet nutrition cultural and religious diets dietary habits are the habitual decisions a person or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat  82  many cultures hold some food preferences and some food taboos  dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion for example only kosher foods are permitted by judaism  halal foods by islam  and in hinduism  beef is restricted  83  in addition the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics this is highly related to a cultures cuisine  diet deficiencies main article avitaminosis dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of adipose tissue known as body fat  84  poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have farreaching effects on health for instance 30 of the worlds population either has or is at risk for developing iodine deficiency   85  it is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to vitamin a deficiency  86   vitamin c deficiency results in scurvy   87   calcium  vitamin d  and phosphorus are interrelated the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others kwashiorkor and marasmus are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein  88  moral ethical and healthconscious diets many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality or other habit for instance vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees others choose a healthier diet  avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and antioxidants   89   obesity  a serious problem in the western world leads to higher chances of developing heart disease  diabetes  and many other diseases  90  more recently dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from genetically modified food   91  further concerns about the impact of industrial farming  grains  on animal welfare  human health and the environment are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits this has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for organic and local food   92  nutrition and dietary problems myplate replaced mypyramid as the usda nutrition guide between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition  there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet deficiencies excesses and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy  obesity  or osteoporosis  diabetes  cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems the science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health nutrients in food are grouped into several categories macronutrients are fat protein and carbohydrates micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins  additionally food contains water and dietary fiber  as previously discussed the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets ideal for hunters and gatherers  thus sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat in modern times with advanced technology  enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers unfortunately this promotes obesity in adults and children alike legal definition some countries list a legal definition of food often referring them with the word foodstuff  these countries list food as any item that is to be processed partially processed or unprocessed for consumption the listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be or reasonably expected to be ingested by humans  in addition to these foodstuffs drink chewing gum  water or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed  live animals unless being prepared for sale in a market plants prior to harvesting medicinal products cosmetics  tobacco and tobacco products narcotic or psychotropic substances  and residues and contaminants  93  types of food comfort food fast food junk

ricotta pancakes yes these are not basic  but this is as crazy as the menu gets these pancakes were impeccable so soft fluffy and dense like a real cake the serving sizes are reasonable for the price

not ideal for a big party or on a busy brunch day like the weekends recommend challah french toast i usually dont order french toast at most places because it becomes too sweet after the first few bites but i enjoyed every bite of my orderand shamelessly finished it  i love the texture of challah bread the syrup was a bit tangy made with orange and the fruit was fresh will come back and try

holiday weekend every reputable breakfast place will be crowded so we were grateful to grab a table at food the small restaurant has a surprisingly large menu with even more options that were available as holiday specials everything sounded so good  both the breakfast and lunch items  so it was difficult to narrow things down ultimately i decided to go in a healthier direction with a customized omelette with spinach mushrooms peppers and feta it came with two pieces of toast the three egg omelette was hearty but lacked seasoning which was disappointing even a little salt and pepper wouldve done the trick the toast was regular wheat toast but the jam was pretty tasty my dining companions ordered the tofu sandwich quiche with salad and the housemade granola and yogurt the lack of seasoning was apparently present on some of the other dishes as well the food came to our table quickly and service was a bit overbearing as our table was being cleared and cleaned before we had finished when we finished we were politely asked to leave by the owner or manager so others could sit at our table she asked in a very respectful manner and she even offered us free desserts which none of us wanted but it was a nice gesture i doubt ill return to food as i wasnt really impressed by the food or the prices but its a cute place to brunch with friends       quiche with greens

selling drinks from beer to milk they have weekly specials that constantly change on the chalk board i ordered the morning sandwich and it was pretty good i thought this was the only dish that sounded

took a drive  we saw a different place and when we went to turn around we happened to turn on the street next to food  we saw a couple people at a table out side and were curious but to be honest it didnt look to promising but curiosity got the best of us and i am glad it did  when we opened the door i couldnt believe it was a full restaurant packed with people the food was very good and tasted really clean yes i know clean sounds weird but it did taste clean and fresh  the waitstaff was really nice and helpful and it felt like a family run home style restaurant it was a little pricey and we were caught off guard with the price of a pound of variety of salads that being said all of the salads were phenomenal  they have a great looking array of desserts as well which thankfully for my diet i managed to avoid but the next time i visit i am trying that bread pudding for sure       sooo good applewood smoked bacon spinach mushrooms and goat cheese    sooo good applewood smoked bacon

across food it was really difficult finding food on google maps because when you type in food they think you are looking for restaurants in general so i stopped by with my bestfriend around 130pm and this place was packed we had to wait for a table so we just got the food to go instead we ordered the ricotta pancakes and the burger we were thinking of the breakfast sandwich but they ran out the burger was cooked perfectly to medium rare it had great flavor and i really liked it the pancakes came with berries and bananas and also a side of butter and syrup either it was really amazing or i was just super hungry the prices are pretty high though we paid 26 for the two things but what can you expect in that area also they have a fridge in the back selling a variety of beverages and random groceries i found my favorite cheese mt tam from cowgirl creamery there i think i will be back to try the breakfast sandwich and to grab a cheese      was this review      useful  2     funny  1

got the green eggs and ham special which is scrambled eggs ham asparagus and pesto sauce  a bread item on the side they run out of a lot of stuff early i think so once again probably best to go early

been but the wait goes by fairly quickly set up its a combination of a deli  restaurant that also has snacks and beverages in a cooler at the back of the restaurant there are two communal tables and a dozen or so two tops throughout the store dont expect to have a leisurely brunch because it really isnt that type of environment food as mentioned i love their ricotta pancakes they are so delicious that i have gone three weekends back to back to enjoy these one on occasion they sold out for the day and i ordered the french toast which didnt prove to be as great my boyfriend enjoys the breakfast special sandwich and gets it each time we go the baristas also do a great job with the coffee and add a cool design on the foam which makes for great presentation my only complaint is that on several occasions my latte doesnt arrive until after my food so i cant enjoy it parking there is street parking and a lot behind the store get here early on the weekend to enjoy the food without a wait enjoy

variety of small business goods like nuts ice cream and jams it was a little before 11 and we had a party of 4 so i was nervous we would have to wait but we got seated almost immediately our server informed us that they change their specials weekly so dont rely on yelp pictures for what you want to order as always i was torn between getting something savory or sweet and ended up getting the

order by choosing your cheese including gruyere goat cheddar choosing your meats and lastly your vegetables he ordered his with a side of avocado and it was very tasty before we left my roommate ordered a nectarine cake to go it was a moist round cake filled with small nectarine squares that tasted very sweet and delicious while we are the owner approached our table to refill our coffees and she engaged in conversation with us only later did we realize she was in fact the owner very friendly and down to earth welcoming and chatty she made the experience very pleasant and kicked up the

thats the way they do it when the restaurant isnt full  being outside they didnt come to our table too often to check on us but when i asked for a refill on my iced tea the same time that i asked for the check they offered to bring it to me in a to go cup awesome in addition to their regular menu they had a list of specials from which i ordered a breakfast sandwich  organic medium eggs with asparagus on a brioche bun  not a combination that i would have normally thought of but worked really well  it wasnt greasy at all and the ingredients tasted fresh and healthy but it was also very fulfilling  the iced tea 2 refill max which is generous was unsweetened how i like it and perfect with just one small packet of splenda we found parking on pico right next to the restaurant without a

at from the outside but inside it was actually quite airy and clean they have a variety of market items like milk  beer  etc inside not enough to go shopping but good to pick up an item you forgot or need while there we had the omelette and breakfast sandwich ice coffee was a bit watered down as was the latte food  45 service  45 value  45 would definitely come back although its not that exciting

was very friendly invited us to take a seat while a server would be with us shortly  we ordered ricotta pancakes and quiche which were both very delicious the staff checked in on us several times to make sure everything was going well  i was so impressed by the food and service i brought another friend for lunch a few days later  when i got there the second time around i followed the same procedure then was told to go up in the front to order before seating  i went up and once i got a menu was asked to order i felt i needed a few minutes  i asked a question about an item on the menu and the owner pointed at the paper on the wall then walked away  she came back less than a minute later and asked if i was standing in the right line  i said i was told to grab a menu and order and then she told me that the line started at the other end where the to go menu line was  when i first got there there was no line so between the to go cash register and the regularno sign register i assumed i was in the right line  by that time there was a line and she ended up pushing me to the back of it  no one came to check on us while we were there and our waters werent being refilled  the owner came around to ask if we were done with our dishes and that was it  the service felt so rushed and chaotic i dont feel like i got to really enjoy my food  i still believe every place takes at least 3 chances  maybe theyre better on weekends when theres only a handful of people dining     was this review      useful      funny      cool                          catharine y    los angeles ca

place is a cute brunch place they have a lot of brunch options which are made with organic fresh ingredients you can really taste the difference its just good food nothing fancy just simple and great i got the ricotta pancakes which are so fluffy and soft theyre delicious by themselves and i didnt even add any syrup or butter my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was really good the bread was soft and they put a lot of arugula  asparagus  egg  cheese  ham in the sandwich so its really just a tasty sandwich i actually switched plates with my boyfriend about 12 way through because i really liked his sandwich  theres parking in the back for 25 cents for 30 minutes we went at 1pm on a sunday and there were a good number of people but it wasnt crowded there was a good flow of

despite the restaurant being packed protip the first check stand is for togo orders and the second check stand is for here orders unfortunately my coworker and i waited in line for about 10 minutes before we were told this i had ordered the 12 sandwich 12 cup of soup with a grilled veggie sandwich onion eggplant peppers mushrooms and mayo and asparagus soup the grilled veggie sandwich usually comes with goat cheese and pesto however i had to substitute mayo because i am lactose intolerant bordering allergic  i think the goat cheese and pesto really add the kick that the sandwich needed to step it up to the next level i wont remove a star for that because it is not foods fault  the soup was really superb and i will definitely be coming back for that service was ok nothing to write home

veggie bowl i ordered was really good it was also very pricy considering you order at the counter 15 unfortunately i had a negative experience at food because the restaurant is not very kid friendly from the moment i walked in to the moment i left i had the feeling that theyd rather not have kids in there at all they have a posted no stroller policy on the door there is no kids menu and at the end of our meal i was accosted by a staff member and asked to keep my son in his high chair id been letting him play quietly on the floor beside my chair for a few minutes while i finished my coffee
