in the medical field clinicians treat diseases and injuries one patient at a time but in public health we prevent disease and injury public health researchers practitioners and educators work with communities and populations  we identify the causes of disease and disability and we implement largescale solutions  for example instead of treating a gunshot wound we work to identify the causes of gun violence and develop interventions instead of treating premature or low birthweight babies we investigate the factors at work and we develop programs to keep babies healthy and instead of prescribing medication for high blood pressure we examine the links among obesity diabetes and heart diseaseand we use our data to influence policy aimed at reducing all three conditions today public health encompasses areas as wideranging as epigenetics chronic disease the science of aging mental health disaster response refugee health injury prevention and tobacco control in public health our microbiologists work to find a vaccine for malaria while our behavioral scientists research ways to discourage populations from smoking our environmental health scientists work to discover which foods

aS'        public health   from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   jump to navigation  search   newspaper headlines from around the world about polio vaccine tests 13 april 1955 public health refers to the science and art of preventing disease prolonging life and promoting health through organized efforts and informed choices of society organizations public and private communities and individuals  1  it is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis the population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents for instance in the case of a pandemic  the dimensions of health can encompass a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity as defined by the united nations world health organization   2  public health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology  biostatistics and health services  environmental health  community health  behavioral health  health economics  public policy  insurance medicine and occupational safety and health are other important subfields the focus of public health intervention is to improve health and quality of life through prevention and treatment of disease and other physical and mental health conditions this is done through surveillance of cases and health indicators  and through promotion of healthy behaviors examples of common public health measures include promotion of hand washing  breastfeeding  delivery of vaccinations  and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals including physicians specializing in public healthcommunity medicineinfectious disease psychologists  epidemiologists  biostatisticians  medical assistants or assistant medical officers  public health nurses  midwives  medical microbiologists  environmental health officers  public health inspectors  pharmacists  dental hygienists  dietitians and nutritionists  veterinarians  public health engineers public health lawyers sociologists  community

programs 41  applications in health care 42  implementing effective improvement strategies 5  see also 6  references 7  bibliography 8  external links objectives  edit  the focus of a public health intervention is to prevent and manage diseases injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors  communities and environments  many diseases are preventable through simple nonmedical methods for example research has shown that the simple act of hand washing with soap can prevent many contagious diseases  4  in other cases treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others such as during an outbreak of infectious disease  or contamination of food or water supplies public health communications programs  vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of common public health measures measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and nongovernmental organizations  the world health organization who is the international agency that coordinates and acts on global public health issues most countries have their own government public health agencies sometimes known as ministries of health to respond to domestic health issues for example in the united states  the front line of public health initiatives are state and local health departments  the united states public health service phs led by the surgeon general of the united states  and the centers for disease control and prevention  headquartered in atlanta  are involved with several international health activities in addition to their national duties in canada the public health agency of canada is the national agency responsible for public health emergency preparedness and response and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention the public health system in india is managed by the ministry of health  family welfare of the government of india with state owned health care facilities there is a great disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed nations and developing nations  in the developing world public health infrastructures are still forming there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention  5  as a result a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty for example many african governments spend less than us 10 per person per year on health care while in the united states the federal government spent approximately us4500 per capita in 2000 however expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health public health measures may not generally be considered health care in the strictest sense for example mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care history  edit  early history  edit  the primitive nature of medieval medicine rendered europe helpless to the onslaught of the black death in the 14th century fragment of a miniature from the chronicles of gilles li muisis 12721352 bibliotheque royale de belgique ms 1307677 f 24v public health has early roots in antiquity from the beginnings of human civilization  it was recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases theory of miasma  early religions attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health from types of food eaten to regulating certain indulgent behaviors such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations  leaders were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability prosperity  and maintain order by roman times it was well understood that proper diversion of human waste was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas the ancient chinese  medical doctors developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 bc an individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals also children were protected by inoculating a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion in 1485 the republic of venice established a permanent court of supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad the three supervisors were initially appointed by the venetian senate in 1537 it was assumed by the grand council and in 1556 added two judges with the task of control on behalf of the republic the efforts of the supervisors  6  however according to michel foucault  the plague model of governmentality was later controverted by the cholera model a cholera pandemic devastated europe between 1829 and 1851 and was first fought by the use of what foucault called social medicine which focused on flux circulation of air location of cemeteries  etc all those concerns born of the miasma theory of disease  were mixed with urbanistic concerns for the management of populations which foucault designated as the concept of  biopower  the german conceptualized this in the polizeiwissenschaft  police science  modern public health  edit  the 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in england   7  the latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries a social evil was identified private philanthropists brought attention to it and changing public opinion led to government action  8  1802 caricature of edward jenner vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages the practice of vaccination became prevalent in the 1800s following the pioneering work of edward jenner in treating smallpox  james lind s discovery of the causes of scurvy amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of fruit on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the royal navy   9  efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public in 1752 the british physician sir john pringle published observations on the diseases of the army in camp and garrison  in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the military  barracks and the provision of latrines for the soldiers  10  with the onset of the industrial revolution  living standards amongst the working population began to worsen with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions in the first four decades of the 19th century alone london s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns such as leeds and manchester  this rapid urbanisation exacerbated the spread of disease in the large conurbations that built up around the workhouses and factories  these settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized sanitation disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of slums and the per capita  death rate began to rise alarmingly almost doubling in birmingham and liverpool  thomas malthus warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798 his ideas as well as those of jeremy bentham  became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century  8  public health legislation  edit  sir edwin chadwick was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign the first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s thomas southwood smith  physician at the london fever hospital  began to write papers on the importance of public health and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the poor law commission in the 1830s along with neil arnott and james phillips kay   11  smith advised the government on the importance of quarantine and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and yellow fever   12   13  the poor law commission reported in 1838 that the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered it recommended the implementation of large scale government engineering projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease  8  the health of towns association was formed in exeter on 11 december 1844 and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the united kingdom   14  its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the health of towns commission chaired by sir edwin chadwick  which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in british cities  14  these national and local movements led to the public health act  finally passed in 1848 it aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in england and wales by placing the supply of water sewerage drainage cleansing and paving under a single local body with the general board of health as a central authority the act was passed by the liberal  government of lord john russell  in response to the urging of edwin chadwick  chadwicks seminal report on the sanitary condition of the labouring population was published in 1842  15  and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later  16  vaccination for various diseases was made compulsory in the united kingdom in 1851 and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers  17  further interventions were made by a series of subsequent public health acts  notably the 1875 act  reforms included latrinization the building of sewers  the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a landfill  the provision of clean water and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes so began the inception of the modern public health in the us the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in new york city in 1866  18  epidemiology  edit  john snow s dot map showing the clusters of cholera cases in the london epidemic of 1854 the science of epidemiology was founded by john snow s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in london dr snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory  he first publicized his theory in an essay on the mode of communication of cholera  in 1849 followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the soho epidemic of 1854  19  by talking to local residents with the help of reverend henry whitehead  he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on broad street now broadwick street  although snows chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the broad street pump did not conclusively prove its danger his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle  20  snow later used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump he also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases he showed that the southwark and vauxhall waterworks company was taking water from sewagepolluted sections of the thames and delivering the water to homes leading to an increased incidence of cholera snows study was a major event in the history of public health and geography it is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology   21  disease control  edit  paullouis simond injecting a plague vaccine in karachi 1898 with the pioneering work in bacteriology of french chemist louis pasteur and german scientist robert koch  methods for isolating the bacteria responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century british physician ronald ross identified the mosquito as the carrier of malaria and laid the foundations for combating the disease  22   joseph lister revolutionized surgery by the introduction of antiseptic  surgery to eliminate infection  french epidemiologist paullouis simond proved that plague was carried by fleas on the back of rats   23  and the americans walter reed and james carroll demonstrated that mosquitoes carry the virus responsible for yellow fever   24  with onset of the epidemiological transition and as the prevalence of infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century  public health began to put more focus on chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease  previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the infant mortality rate using preventative methods in britain the infant mortality rate fell from over 15 in 1870 to 7 by 1930  25  united states  edit  public health nursing made available through child welfare services in us c 1930s in the united states public health worker dr sara josephine baker established many programs to help the poor in new york city keep their infants healthy leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of hells kitchen and teaching mothers how to dress feed and bathe their babies dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century is widely credited to public health achievements such as vaccination programs and control of many infectious diseases including polio  diphtheria  yellow fever and smallpox  effective health and safety policies such as road traffic safety and occupational safety  improved family planning  tobacco control measures and programs designed to decrease noncommunicable diseases by acting on known risk factors such as a persons background lifestyle and environment another major public health improvement was the decline in the urban penalty brought about by improvements in sanitation  these improvements included chlorination of drinking water filtration and sewage treatment which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious waterborne diseases such as cholera and intestinal diseases  26  the federal office of indian affairs oia operated a largescale field nursing program field nurses targeted native women for health education emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition  27  recent  edit  emergency response team in burma after cyclone nargis in 2008 large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases and poor maternal and child health exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty the who reports that a lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year  28   intermittent preventive therapy aimed at treating and preventing malaria episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in endemic countries each day brings new frontpage headlines about public health emerging infectious diseases such as sars  rapidly making its way from china see public health in china  to canada the united states and other geographically distant countries reducing inequities in health care access through publicly funded health insurance programs the hivaids pandemic and its spread from certain highrisk groups to the general population in many countries such as in south africa  the increase of childhood obesity and the concomitant increase in type ii diabetes among children the social economic and health effects of adolescent pregnancy  and the public health challenges related to natural disasters such as the 2004 indian ocean tsunami  2005s hurricane katrina in the united states and the 2010 haiti earthquake  since the 1980s the growing field of population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to populationlevel issues such as inequality  poverty and education modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population there is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live genetics our income our educational status and our social relationships these are known as  social determinants of health  a social gradient in health runs through society the poorest generally suffer the worst health but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum  29  the new public health advocates for populationbased policies that improve health in an equitable manner public health 20  edit  public health 20 is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more userdriven the term is used in three senses in the first sense public health 20 is similar to  health 20  and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out or could reach out to the public through social media and health blogs   30   31  in the second sense public health 20 describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites search engine queries cell phones or other technologies  32  in the third sense public health 20 is used to describe public health activities that are completely userdriven  33  an example is the collection and sharing of information about environmental radiation levels after the march 2011 tsunami in japan  34  in all cases public health 20 draws on ideas from web 20  such as crowdsourcing  information sharing  and usercentred design   35  education and training  edit  education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in schools of public health medical schools veterinary schools schools of nursing and schools of public affairs the training typically requires a university degree with a focus on core disciplines of biostatistics  epidemiology  health services administration  health policy  health education  behavioral science and environmental health   36   37  in the global context the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades supported by institutions such as the world health organization and the world bank  among others operational structures are formulated by strategic principles with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks all requiring modulation according to local national and global realities it is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity and not depend on other countries to supply it  38  schools of public health  an american perspective  edit  in the united states  the welchrose report of 1915  39  has been viewed as the basis for the critical movement in the history of the institutional schism between public health and medicine because it led to the establishment of schools of public health supported by the rockefeller foundation   40  the report was authored by william welch  founding dean of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health  and wycliffe rose of the rockefeller foundation the report focused more on research than practical education  40   41  some have blamed the rockefeller foundations 1916 decision to support the establishment of schools of public health for creating the schism between public health and medicine and legitimizing the rift between medicines laboratory investigation of the mechanisms of disease and public healths nonclinical concern with environmental and social influences on health and wellness  40   42  even though schools of public health had already been established in canada  europe and north africa  the united states had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions a 25000 donation from businessman samuel zemurray instituted the school of public health and tropical medicine at tulane university in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914  43   44  the johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health became the an independent degreegranting institution for research and training in public health and the largest public health training facility in the united states  45   46   47   48  when it was founded in 1916 by 1922 schools of public health were established at columbia  harvard and yale on the hopkins model by 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the us enrolling around fifteen thousand students  36   40  over the years the types of students and training provided have also changed in the beginning students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree public health school training was largely a second degree for medical professionals  however in 1978 69 of american students enrolled in public health schools had only a bachelors degree   36  degrees in public health  edit  main article professional degrees of public health schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories professional or academic  49  the two major postgraduate degrees are the master of public health mph or the master of science in public health msph doctoral studies in this field include doctor of public health drph and doctor of philosophy phd in a subspeciality of greater public health disciplines drph is regarded as a professional leadership degree and phd as more of an academic degree professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings the master of public health  doctor of public health  doctor of health science dhsc and the master of health care administration are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments managed care and communitybased organizations hospitals and consulting firms among others master of public health degrees broadly fall into two categories those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies a master of science of public health is similar to an mph but is considered an academic degree as opposed to a professional degree and places more emphasis on quantitative methods and research the same distinction can be made between the drph and the dhsc the drph is considered a professional degree and the dhsc is an academic degree  citation needed  academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and preventive medicine who wish to pursue careers in research university teaching in graduate programs policy analysis and development and other highlevel public health positions examples of academic degrees are the master of science  doctor of philosophy  doctor of science scd and doctor of health science dhsc the doctoral programs are distinct from the mph and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a dissertation research project in the united states the association of schools of public health  50  represents council on education for public health ceph accredited schools of public health  51   delta omega is the honor society for graduate studies in public health the society was founded in 1924 at the johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health  currently there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the united states and puerto rico  52  public health programs  edit  today  when  most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease disability and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine  53  in recent years  when  public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health including the eradication of smallpox  a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years three former directors of the global smallpox eradication programme read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated 1980 the world health organization who identifies core functions of public health programs including  54  providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed shaping a research agenda and stimulating the generation translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation articulating ethical and evidencebased policy options monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends in particular public health surveillance programs can  55  serve as an early warning system for impending public health emergencies document the impact of an intervention or track progress towards specified goals and monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems allow priorities to be set and inform health policy and strategies diagnose investigate and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today including hivaids  diabetes  waterborne diseases  zoonotic diseases  and antibiotic resistance leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis  antibiotic resistance also known as drug resistance was the theme of world health day 2011  although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important laurie garrett argues that there are following consequences  56  when foreign aid is funneled into diseasespecific programs the importance of public health in general is disregarded this public health problem of stovepiping is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country for example the who reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes its incidence is increasing rapidly and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030  57  in a june 2010 editorial in the medical journal the lancet  the authors opined that the fact that type 2 diabetes a largely preventable disorder has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation  58  the risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of obesity  the whos latest  when  estimates highlighted that globally approximately 15 billion adults were overweight in 2008 and nearly 43 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010  59  the united states is the leading country with 306 of its population being obese mexico follows behind with 242 and the united kingdom with 23 once considered a problem in highincome countries it is now on the rise in lowincome countries especially in urban settings many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity with objectives to address the underlying causes including healthy diet and physical exercise  some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial one such example is programs focusing on the prevention of hiv transmission through safe sex campaigns and needleexchange programmes  another is the control of tobacco smoking  changing smoking behavior requires longterm strategies unlike the fight against communicable diseases  which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places proponents  who  argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate both through limiting passive secondhand smoking and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke opponents  who  say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall simultaneously while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a global health priority noncommunicable diseases and the underlying behaviorrelated risk factors have been at the bottom this is changing however as illustrated by the united nations hosting its first general assembly special summit on the issue of noncommunicable diseases in september 2011  60  many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors from an evolutionary psychology perspective over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved reward system for substances such as drugs tobacco alcohol refined salt fat and carbohydrates new technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects thus the increased use of soap and handwashing to prevent diarrhea is much more effectively promoted if its lack of use is associated with the emotion of disgust  disgust is an evolved system for avoiding contact with substances that spread infectious diseases examples might include films that show how fecal matter contaminates food the marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others conversely it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking  61  applications in health care  edit  as well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific populationlevel interventions public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for health care services including  62   63   64   65  assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the health care system ascertaining requirements as expressed by health professionals  the public and other stakeholders identifying the most appropriate interventions considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their costeffectiveness supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes informing educating and empowering people about health issues implementing effective improvement strategies  edit  to improve public health one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign which is recommended by armanda solorzana through a case study of the rockefeller foundations hookworm campaign in mexico in the 1920s soloranza argues that public health policy cant concern only politics or economics political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions such as upcoming elections therefore scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions  66  the history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all  citation needed  however in modernday medicine real measurable change has not been clearly seen and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented as argued by paul e farmer structural interventions could possibly have a large impact and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system one of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements while structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity global public health can ultimately not be achieved  citation needed  this being the case without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved  67  see also  edit  10 essential public health

disciplines          such as medicine dentistry nursing optometry nutrition social work environmental          sciences health education health services administration and the behavioral          sciences its activities focus on entire populations rather than on individual          patients  doctors treat individual patients oneonone for a specific disease          or injury thus patients need

practitioner  qualityfirst urgent care    kate joeckel  program director  bellevue university     introduction  public health may conjure images of community medical clinics or awareness campaigns promoting healthy living but the field is not nearly so narrow instead public health professionals are involved in everything from identifying diseases to creating public policy to helping refugees integrate into new communities  according to the association of schools and programs of public health aspph there are ten common areas of study for those entering the field these areas can lead to careers such as health educators and community outreach workers but the health department isnt the only place hiring public health majors  the following guide dives deeper into these careers and others within the public health sphere it leverages expert interviews information and resources to better understand the professional landscape as well as the various educational options needed to enter advance and succeed in the field specific goals of the guidebook include   dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding public health  explaining the skills gained by public health students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels  exploring the diverse occupations and career paths that can come from a public health degree  providing industryspecific resources for students  leveraging experts in the field to get the most valuable information possible     what is public health  public health careers might be misunderstood because the field can be difficult to             define at one level public health involves medical care provided within a community             and outside a hospital setting in a different context public health can have global             repercussions and refer to efforts to prevent epidemics and improve the health of             entire nations  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc says public health systems             are complex and require the coordination of multiple organizations there is usually             a public agency such as a health department working in tandem with schools medical providers churches employers and more  together these systems should strive to provide the following ten essential services outlined by the cdc   monitor health status to identify and solve community health problems  diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community  inform educate and empower people about health issues  mobilize community partnerships and action to identify and solve health problems  develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts  enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety  link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable  assure competent public and personal health care workforce  evaluate effectiveness accessibility and quality of personal and populationbased health services  research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems   as a result an incredibly diverse number of occupations fall under the umbrella of public health these may include the familiar jobs of epidemiologists who help prevent the spread of disease to more outsidethebox career options such as marketing professionals who work on wellness campaigns or law enforcement officials focused on substance abuse prevention    specialties within the public health field  with public health being such a  broad field  students typically focus their studies on a particular area while undergraduate degrees may be specialized this is especially true at the graduate level some concentrations in public health focus on math and statistics while others fall into the realm of social sciences still others may result in jobs in public relations marketing or community outreach the degree emphasis can also influence whether a graduate goes on to find employment within a government agency private firm or as a private consultant  according to the aspph these are ten most common areas of study   biostatistics and informatics  as a subset of statistics biostatistics is the analysis of data and its application to health care public health professionals focusing on biostatistics use models to track the health of a population and identify trends they may be involved in clinical trials genome projects and spatial studies which seek to determine how geography can affect health and risk factors informatics is a related field that may focus more on surveillance and the collection of data for prevention and public health promotion rather than its application in research  this specialty may be best for those who enjoy numbers and have an aptitude for math  those who do enter the field should have plenty of job opportunities as qualified biostatisticians seem to be in short supply the american statistical association notes on its website biostatisticians should have excellent career opportunities in academia industry and government the association also reports a shortage of professionals in the field was identified as part of a report to the president and congress on the status of health personnel in the united states  students who graduate with a public health concentration in biostatistics and informatics may go on to work in the following positions among others   biostatistician  medical and health services manager  health informatics specialist    community health  while biostatisticians and informatics professionals are largely concerned with collecting and analyzing hard data community health specialists take a more holistic look at public health their work involves considering the many dynamics

after graduation students use their knowledge to focus on how best to reach vulnerable community members and better allocate resources to underserved populations they may initiate wellness programs

health professionals who focus on community health   health care administrator  health educator  community health worker    epidemiology  sometimes referred to as the basic science of public health epidemiology brings together aspects of biostatistics and community health epidemiologists monitor the spread of diseases and work to understand their causes and develop solutions to work in the field individuals need to have a strong foundation in math and statistics in order to properly interpret data in addition they need to understand the complex factors  from socioeconomic to educational  that can lead to public health threats and then use this knowledge to form an effective response  epidemiologists are often employed by government agencies such as local health departments the department of health and human services and the centers for disease control and prevention however they may also find jobs with international organizations or private companies such as pharmaceutical companies some epidemiologists work independently as consultants the bureau of labor statistics reports career options should remain steady for epidemiologists with 10 percent job growth expected from 20122022  the following are some job titles that may be held by those with a public health degree in epidemiology   epidemiologist  field investigator  research analyst    environmental health  the world health

students concentrating in environmental health may learn about these and other external factors such as water quality that can affect a populations health after graduation they may go on to work in positions focused on prevention research or community outreach to minimize the impact of these environmental risks  in addition some public health schools have expanded their definition of environmental health to include social environment the bloomberg school of public health at john hopkins university notes the social environment can include factors such as neighborhood safety political empowerment and socioeconomic factors in this way environmental health can be seen as an outreach of community health  job titles for those working in environmental health include the

sanitation solutions that target remote and impoverished areas i work mostly on africabased projects my most recent project took place in rural mozambique we developed and built rainwater harvest systems at six local schools the kids and other villagers could use the water to drink bathe cook and irrigate their crops  what drew you to public health  in college i became obsessed with the fact that almost half the globe didnt have access to clean water and basic sanitation that seemed like a solvable problem to me with so many clean energy initiatives and billions of dollars poured into green tech every year there had to be room for clean water initiatives i was so interesting and important to me at the beginning of my junior year i decided to major in public health i earned my bachelors degree and am almost finished with my masters    health policy and management  pulling from a variety of disciplines health policy and management professionals need to be knowledgeable about economics politics management and finance those studying the field  may find their coursework is a mix of law ethics and health care after graduation health policy workers  may be responsible for crafting policies that ensure access to medical care and provide uniform services across various populations  individuals working in health policy and management should be critical thinkers and

resources and improve health knowledge among underserved communities  minority health workers often serve one of the following populations racial and ethnic minorities native americans refugees or immigrants they must have a strong grasp of social norms for these minority groups and may have to overcome language and cultural barriers to help improve the health of these populations these

for example psychology psychiatry and social work are all important components of this specialization  workers may further focus their career on specific health concerns such as obesity mental health or substance abuse  behavioral health careers are expected to see faster than average growth during the next decade demand for social workers should increase 19 percent from 20122022 according to the bureau of labor statistics meanwhile the bureau says jobs for mental health counselors should increase 29 percent during that same time period for some of these positions states may have additional

degree may be required before enrolling in a public health degree program students should have a firm grasp on the level of education needed for their desired position within the field in order to specialize students may need to spend up to six years studying both general public health principles as well as their area of focus  these are the most common degree levels offered by public health

associate degree in public health may allow graduates to apply for some entrylevel and administrative support positions in addition if a student decides to pursue more education in the field associate degree credits typically transfer and can be applied toward a bachelors degree  bachelors degree in public health  at the bachelors degree level students are often given the opportunity to explore multiple specializations within the public health field for those who plan to go onto a graduate degree this is an excellent time for students to decide which area of public health they would like to pursue as a career  public health schools may offer a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts to its students a bs may focus on natural science and could be a better option for those expecting to go into research or specializations such as biostatistics and epidemiology a ba may have a greater emphasis on social sciences making it a good option for students interested in community health social and behavioral health or health promotion and communication however school admissions offices and college public health departments should be able to assist students in selecting the right degree path

public health is or what jobs are available in the field of public health answer while clinical health entails diagnosis and treatment of diseases in individual patients public health entails prevention and education of the general public to help improve the overall health and reduce risks to a population    in other words people who work in public health do not diagnose or treat patients on an individual basis like doctors and nurses do in a clinical setting public health professionals research and track health trends including behavioral biological and environmental factors they then utilize that research to help predict and prevent future health events or problems that could impact the health of the general population public health also includes the education of the public on ways to defend themselves against health risks public health combines many other disciplines and skills with the healthcare industry to offer a variety of occupations within those agencies there are hundreds of professionals such as scientists medical lab workers  biostatisticians medical researchers medical doctors  and more all working together to help fight the next threat to the nationas health additionally there are many nonmedical positions such as administrators human resources accounting public relationscommunications professionals who all help the public health organization to

public health infrastructure provides a useful framework for addressing the social determinants of health emerging issues in public health infrastructure increasing attention to public health infrastructure has led to the identification of a number of emerging issues tribal public health infrastructure each tribe is an independent government that must adopt local strategies to meet its public health challenges interventions must be tailored to the cultural beliefs and practices of each tribe there are many ways tribal entities are served through the indian health service tribal epidemiology centers and national organizations however challenges remain disparities in the public health workforce as minority populations in the united states increase the country will need a more diverse public health workforce hispanics american indians and alaska natives and african americans are underrepresented in the public health workforce accreditation of public health agencies in an effort to standardize services and improve performance public health agencies are moving toward a voluntary national accreditation program this program will highlight agencies commitment to service and quality and provide a standard toward which all public health agencies can work  public health systems research expanding the evidence base for community interventions and for the effective organization administration and financing of public health services is critical to the future development of public health infrastructure the emerging field of public health systems and services research is playing an important role in the development of this evidence base its role should be supported and expanded over the decade with a strong focus on translating research into practice public health law novel policies are being developed to address legal and political challenges resulting from new and reemerging infectious diseases and increasing levels of chronic disease new
