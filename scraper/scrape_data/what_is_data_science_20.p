 it employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics  statistics  information theory and information technology  including signal processing  probability models  machine learning  statistical learning  computer programming  data engineering  pattern recognition and learning  visualization  predictive analytics  uncertainty modeling  data warehousing  data compression and high performance computing  methods that scale to big data are of particular interest in data science although the discipline is not generally considered to be restricted to such data the development of machine learning  a branch of artificial intelligence used to uncover patterns in data from which predictive models can be developed has enhanced the growth and importance of data science data scientists apply expertise in data preparation statistics and machine learning to investigate complex problems in many various domains such as marketing optimization fraud detection setting public policy etc these areas represent great breadth and diversity of knowledge and a data scientist will most likely be expert in only one or at most two of these areas and merely proficient in the others therefore a data scientist typically works as part of a team whose other members have knowledge and skills which complement his or hers  3  data scientists use the ability to find and interpret rich data sources manage large amounts of data despite hardware software and bandwidth constraints merge data sources ensure consistency of datasets create visualizations to aid in understanding data build mathematical models using the data and present and communicate the data insightsfindings preferably actionable insights to specialists and scientists in their team and if required to a nontechnical audience data science techniques affect research in many domains including the biological sciences  medical informatics  health care  social sciences and the humanities  it heavily influences economics  business and finance  from the business perspective data science is an integral part of competitive intelligence a newly emerging field that encompasses a number of activities such as data mining and data analysis   4  contents 1  history 2  domain specific interests 3  criticism 4  research areas 41  security data science 42  clinical data science 43  genomic

thirty years and was used initially as a substitute for computer science by peter naur in 1960 in 1974 naur published concise survey of computer methods  which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications in 1996 members of the international federation of classification societies ifcs met in kobe for their biennial conference here for the first time the term data science is included in the title of the conference data science classification and related methods  5  in november 1997 cf jeff wu gave the inaugural lecture entitled statistics  data science  6  for his appointment to the h c carver professorship at the university of michigan  7  in this lecture he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection data modeling and analysis and decision making in conclusion he coined the term data science and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists  6  later he presented his lecture entitled statistics  data science as the first of his 1998 pc mahalanobis memorial lectures  8  these lectures honor prasanta chandra mahalanobis  an indian scientist and statistician and founder of the indian statistical institute  in 2001 william s cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline extending the field of statistics to incorporate advances in computing with data in his article data science an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics which was published in volume 69 no 1 of the april 2001 edition of the international statistical review  revue internationale de statistique  9  in his report cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science multidisciplinary investigations models and methods for data computing with data pedagogy tool evaluation and theory in april 2002 the international council for science committee on data for science and technology codata  10  started the data science journal   11  a publication focused on issues such as the description of data systems their publication on the internet applications and legal issues  12  shortly thereafter in january 2003 columbia university began publishing the journal of data science   13  which provided a platform for all data workers to present their views and exchange ideas the journal was largely devoted to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research in 2005 the national science board published longlived digital data collections enabling research and education in the 21st century defining data scientists as the information and computer scientists database and software and programmers disciplinary experts curators and expert annotators librarians archivists and others who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection whose primary activity is to conduct creative inquiry and analysis  14  in 2008  citation needed   dj patil and jeff hammerbacher coined the term data scientist to define their jobs at linkedin and facebook respectively  15  domain specific interests  edit  data science is the practice of deriving valuable insights from data data science is emerging to meet the challenges of processing very large data sets ie big data consisting of structured unstructured or semistructured data that large enterprises produce a domain at center stage of data science is the explosion of new data generated from smart devices web mobile and social media data science requires a versatile skillset many practicing data scientists commonly specialize in specific domains such as the fields of marketing medical security fraud and finance however data scientists rely heavily upon elements of statistics  machine learning  optimization  signal processing  text retrieval and natural language processing to analyze data and interpret results criticism  edit  although use of the term data science has exploded in business environments many academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and statistics  writing in forbes  gil press argues that data science is a buzzword without a clear definition and has simply replaced business analytics in contexts such as graduate degree programs  16  in the questionandanswer section of his keynote address at the joint statistical meetings of american statistical association  noted applied statistician nate silver said i think datascientist is a sexed up term for a statisticianstatistics is a branch of science data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldnt berate the term statistician  17  research areas  edit  as an interdisciplinary subject data science draws scientific inquiry from a broad range of academic subject areas mostly related to the hard sciences some areas of research are cloud computing databases and information integration signal processing learning natural language processing and information extraction computer vision information retrieval and web information access knowledge discovery in social and information networks information visualization security data science  edit  data science has a long and rich history in security and fraud monitoring reference needed  security data science is focused on advancing information security through practical applications of exploratory data analysis statistics machine learning and data visualization although the tools and techniques are no different that those used in data science in any data domain this group has a microfocus on reducing risk identifying fraud or malicious insiders using data science the information security and fraud prevention industry have been evolving security data science in order to tackle the challenges of managing and gaining insights from huge streams of log data discover insider threats and prevent fraud data science companies like feedzai  18  use a mix of big data machine learning and human intelligence to identify fraudulent payment transactions security data science is data driven  meaning that new insights and value comes directly from data  19  clinical data science  edit  data science has always been prominent in the field of clinical trials  timely insight into clinical data provides answers to medical questions documenting the safety and efficacy of novel and existing therapeutic compounds with large and complex data clinical data scientists have been producing statistical analyses of clinical trials for marketing applications since clinical development has been required in the early 2000s the clinical data scientist evolved from a role of a consultant to statisticians to a strategic one now the clinical data scientist assists in the planning collection transformation analysis and reporting of clinical trial data and communication of their results these scientists are crucial to the determination of safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic compounds genomic data science  edit  application of data science does not only stop at clinical trials it was also applied to learning the proteins and dna sequences in genomics  this field because of the tools of the data scientist the work for analyzing and studying dna structures viruses and other biological pathogens handling of data is around before but using data science will make it easier for handling vast amount of data in genomics and make the procedures repeatable conferences  edit  dataedge conference data education a new generation of datasavvy professionals held by

professionals who can work effectively with data at scale is limited and is reflected by rapidly rising salaries for data engineers data scientists statisticians and data analysts a recent study by the mckinsey global institute concludes a shortage of the analytical and managerial talent necessary to make the most of big data is a significant and pressing challenge for the us the report estimates that there will be four to five million jobs in the us requiring data analysis skills by 2018 and that large numbers of positions will only be filled through training or retraining the authors also project a need for 15 million more managers and analysts with deep analytical and technical skills who can ask the right questions and consume the results of analysis of big data effectively the statistics listed below represent this significant and growing demand for data scientists 15 highest paying job in demand 3433 number of job openings 105395 average base salary 9 best

digitizing analog content that was created over centuries and collecting myriad new types of data from web logs mobile devices sensors instruments and transactions ibm estimates that 90 percent of the data in the world today has been created in the past two years at the same time new technologies are emerging to organize and make sense of this avalanche of data we can now identify patterns and regularities in data of all sorts that allow us to advance scholarship improve the human condition and create commercial and social value the rise of big data has the potential to deepen our understanding of phenomena ranging from physical and biological systems to human social and economic behavior  a challenge identified virtually every sector of the economy now has access to more data than would have been imaginable even a decade ago businesses today are accumulating new data at a rate that exceeds their capacity to extract value from it the question facing every organization that wants to attract a community is how to use data effectively  not just their own data but all of the data thats available and relevant this hot new field promises to revolutionize industries from business to government health care to academia  the new york times our ability to derive social and economic value from the newly available data is limited by the lack of expertise working with this data requires distinctive new skills and tools the corpuses are often too voluminous to fit on a single computer to manipulate with traditional databases or statistical tools or to represent using standard graphics software the data is also more heterogeneous than the highly curated data of the past digitized text audio and visual content like sensor and weblog data is typically messy incomplete and unstructured it is often of uncertain provenance and quality and frequently must be combined with other data to be useful working with usergenerated data sets also raises challenging issues of privacy security and ethics the field of data science is emerging at the intersection of the fields of social science and statistics information and computer science and design the uc berkeley school of information is ideally positioned to bring these disciplines together and to provide students with the research and professional skills to succeed in leading edge organizations

rising   mahesh srinivasan  more loading data scientists are people with some mix of coding and statistical skills who work on making data useful in various ways in my world there are two main types type a data scientist the a is for analysis this type is primarily concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static waythe type a data scientist is very similar to a statistician and may be one but knows all the practical details of working with data that arent taught in the statistics curriculum  data cleaning methods for dealing with very large data sets visualization deep knowledge of a particular domain writing well about data and so on the type a data scientist can code well enough to work with data but is not necessarily an expert the type a data scientist may be an expert in experimental design forecasting modeling statistical inference or other things typically taught in statistics departments generally speaking though the work product of a data scientist is not pvalues and confidence intervals as academic statistics sometimes seems to suggest and as it sometimes is for traditional statisticians working in the pharmaceutical industry for example at google type a data scientists are known variously as statistician quantitative analyst decision support engineering analyst or data scientist and probably a few more type b data scientist the b is for building type b data scientists share some statistical background with type a but they are also very strong coders and may be trained software engineers  the type b data scientist is mainly interested in using data in production  they build models which interact with users often serving recommendations products people you may know ads movies search results at google a type b data scientist would typically be called a software engineer type b data scientists may use the term data scientist to refer just to themselves and since the definition of the field is very much in flux they may be right but i see the term being used most often in the general way i am proposing here this categorization is crude many data scientists are some mix of a and b but this answer is long enough already embed quote written 16 jan 2014  20364 views  asked to answer by  william chen  upvote 308 downvote comments 4  more answers below related questions  what is the data science topic faq

first the term data science is a misnomer with respect to what most people consider endeavors classified as such  fundamentally science is about formalizing a hypothesis given a reasonable set of observations and assumptions designing an experiment around that hypothesis testings it and analyzing the data generated through that process to either confirm or falsify the hypothesis  therefore data is simply a natural byproduct of science  very very rarely are things labeled as data science actually scientific rather data science most often refers to the tools and methods used to analyze large amounts of data  as such the discipline is an amalgamation of many bits from other areas of research  for tools the influence primarily comes from computer science where issues of algorithmic efficiency and storage scalability form the main focus  for analysis however the influences are much more varied modern methods are borrowed from both the socalled hard sciences physics statistics graph theory and the social sciences economics sociology political sciences etc  specific classes of techniques that are naturally interdisciplinary are also very popular such as machine learning mike

 quora user  data scientist data scientist 33  upvotes by  david toyli   mert kilickaya   tariq alsadoon  more loading i have been a data scientist for about two years here are some quick thoughts on what i think data science is or why dont we start with what data science is not first data science is not a software engineering piece of work that is data science is not about building products or product features or systems or any related fancy things second data science is not a visualization piece of work creating the cool visual is neither the end goal nor the beginning part of how a data scientist works needless to say data science is not about creating visually impactful infographics third data science is not a scientific piece of work in particular data scientists dont work in the academia it is the industrys particular requirements and the business markets call that makes the job of data scientist needed data scientists usually dont publish papers and neither is the paper or book publishing business part of any data scientists daily concerns last but not least i dont agree with the public view that data science is at least mostly statistics just to cite a quick story of myself once i was asked to hire someone to assist my work and ended up interviewing lots of applicants through phone many of the applicants came from the filed of statistical analysis and most of these applicants tended to sound really confident that he or she would be more than qualified for the role however i didnt end up calling any of them onsite one thing i realized at that time was that statistical knowledge alone doesnt make a person qualified for assisting me effectively on the kind of data science work that i needed to do for reasons ill mention in a short while now we are ready to talk about what data science is its a thing that encapsulates some programming skills some statistical readiness some visualization techniques and last but not least a lot of business senses the kind of business sense that i in particular care about is the ability and willingness sometimes eagerness to translate any business questions into questions answerable using currently or forthcomingly available data within ones reach in fact it takes a special way of connecting all the dots in the random world full of data most of which you may not find immediately useful to make a working data scientist a data scientist based on my current understanding is the person who connects the dots between the business world and the data world similarly data science is the craft that a data scientist utilizes to make this happen im going to share a favorite analogue of mine about data science doing data science is like preparing a meal one starts with data munging which includes but is not restricted to etl extract transform and load data cleansing data debugging etc this is the step similar to preparing the food source where you rinse cleans the vegetables the meat and the rice chop the food source into reasonably sized pieces and put them aside after that is done you are ready to cook the food source which corresponds to data exploration feature construction feature reduction running and ensembling the algorithms etc this is when you cook the vegetable and meat in a stepbystep fashion adding ingredients and sources on particularly calculated timing and watching the raw material turn into edible pieces the last step is to serve the food when you arrange the cooked food in artistic ways and serve them in a particular sequence of first course second course etc to customers who ordered the food to begin with this is when you prepare your data mining results in artistic visualization and create reports or data stories to send to the business users who wanted this piece of data science work to be done on the first place summarizing the above the process of data science consists of data munging data mining and delivering actionable insights based on my own experience a common toolset to get all or part of these done include python r tableau sql etc python is particularly handy as an allpurpose tool especially great for data munging it can also be used for data mining thanks to the almighty scikitlearn package and even insight delivering based on its fast growing graphing abilities r is a bit shy on data munging compared to python however because of its nature of being statistically complete  a word i just made up meaning that any statistical thingie you have ever heard of is most likely already represented by a r package or two  r is great for exploring the data and running algorithms on different parameter settings this makes r a great tool for prototyping data science  for example to identify the key feature set as well as a good enough machine learning algorithm with parameter setting before you start to write complicated production code for real in addition to the above r is also powerful with its visualization packages and can be used to turn a repeatable data mining piece into a shiny report talking about data visualization tableau is one of the best commercial software for visually explore your data it is also handy for creating interactive visualization reports or data stories besides python r tableau theres one more data science tool that i want to mention before finishing this post sql is the language of english in the world of data munging or at least have been so for a very long time it is powerful in integrating different data sources and handy for data exploration and data debugging these are just my two cents on what data science is i hope it make sense to you so far im still a learner and merely a beginner in this field and i expect to pick up a lot more and deeper understanding on this subject matter in the near future embed quote updated 22 mar  1607 views  upvote 33 downvote comments 2   shlomo argamon  director of the master of data scienc  more  director of the master of data science

for analyzing large and complex data sets more than just collaboration between computer scientists and statisticians and far more than just a fancy term for statistics in san francisco or the like at its core data science is about making sense of the world using data this involves the use of various tools for data cleaning structuring querying analysis visualization and the like involves statistical modeling to some extent often involves building new computational tools involves figuring out the right relevant questions to ask the data and how to explain what the data say and dont say and critically involves application of the scientific method to ensure that results are solid and properly understood hence the word science in the name in a sense this is a new word for work that scientists and statisticians have done for a long time but the new abundance of data that carry information about virtually everything together with the availability of tools computational and statistical to work with the data makes the task of empirical sensemaking ie data science more broadly applicable and more important than before embed quote written 17 jul 2014  3764 views  upvote 30

companies and people that turn data into products   by  mike loukides   mikeloukides  mike loukides  june 2 2010                 sections where data comes from working with data at scale making data tell its story data scientists download this free report weve all heard it according to hal varian statistics is the next sexy job  five years ago in what is web 20  tim oreilly said that data is the next intel inside but what does that statement mean why do we suddenly care about statistics and about data in this post i examine the many sides of data science  the technologies the companies and the unique skill sets the web is full of datadriven apps almost any ecommerce application is a datadriven application theres a database behind a web front end and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services credit card processing companies banks and so on but merely using data isnt really what we mean by data science a data application acquires its value from the data itself and creates more data as a result its not just an application with data its a data product data science enables the creation of data products one of the earlier data products on the web was the cddb database  the developers of cddb realized that any cd had a unique signature based on the exact length in samples of each track on the cd gracenote built a database of track lengths and coupled it to a database of album metadata track titles artists album titles if youve ever used itunes to rip a cd youve taken advantage of this database before it does anything else itunes reads the length of every track sends it to cddb and gets back the track titles if you have a cd thats not in the database including a cd youve made yourself you can create an entry for an unknown album while this sounds simple enough its revolutionary cddb views music as data not as audio and creates new value in doing so their business is fundamentally different from selling music sharing music or analyzing musical tastes though these can also be data products cddb arises entirely from viewing a musical problem as a data problem google is a master at creating data products heres a few examples googles breakthrough was realizing that a search engine could use input other than the text on the page googles pagerank algorithm was among the first to use data outside of the page itself in particular the number of links pointing to a page tracking links made google searches much more useful and pagerank has been a key ingredient to the companys success spell checking isnt a terribly difficult problem but by suggesting corrections to misspelled searches and observing what the user clicks in response google made it much more accurate theyve built a dictionary of common misspellings their corrections and the contexts in which they occur speech recognition has always been a hard problem and it remains difficult but google has made huge strides by using the voice data theyve collected and has been able to integrate voice search into their core search engine during the swine flu epidemic of 2009 google was able to track the progress of the epidemic by following searches for flurelated topics  flu trends google was able to spot trends in the swine flu epidemic roughly two weeks before the center for disease control by analyzing searches that people were making in different regions of the country google isnt the only company that knows how to use data facebook and linkedin use patterns of friendship relationships to suggest other people you may know or should know with sometimes frightening accuracy amazon saves your searches correlates what you search for with what other users search for and uses it to create surprisingly appropriate recommendations these recommendations are data products that help to drive amazons more traditional retail business they come about because amazon understands that a book isnt just a book a camera isnt just a camera and a customer isnt just a customer customers generate a trail of data exhaust that can be mined and put to use and a camera is a cloud of data that can be correlated with the customers behavior the data they leave every time they visit the site the thread that ties most of these applications together is that data collected from users provides added value whether that data is search terms voice samples or product reviews the users are in a feedback loop in which they contribute to the products they use thats the beginning of data science in the last few years there has been an explosion in the amount of data thats available whether were talking about web server logs tweet streams online transaction records citizen science data from sensors government data or some other source the problem isnt finding data its figuring out what to do with it and its not just companies using their own data or the data contributed by their users its increasingly common to mashup data from a number of sources data mashups in r analyzes mortgage foreclosures in philadelphia county by taking a public report from the county sheriffs office extracting addresses and using yahoo to convert the addresses to latitude and longitude then using the geographical data to place the foreclosures on a map another data source and group them by neighborhood valuation neighborhood percapita income and other socioeconomic factors the question facing every company today every startup every nonprofit every project site that wants to attract a community is how to use data effectively  not just their own data but all the data thats available and relevant using data effectively requires something different from traditional statistics where actuaries in business suits perform arcane but fairly welldefined kinds of analysis what differentiates data science from statistics is that data science is a holistic approach were increasingly finding data in the wild and data scientists are involved with gathering data massaging it into a tractable form making it tell its story and presenting that story to others to get a sense for what skills are required lets look at the data lifecycle where it comes from how you use it and where it goes where data comes from data is everywhere your government your web server your business partners even your body  while we arent drowning in a sea of data were finding that almost everything can or has been instrumented at oreilly we frequently combine publishing industry data from nielsen bookscan with our own sales data publicly available amazon data and even job data to see

on display at ibm almaden research much of the data we currently work with is the direct consequence of web 20 and of moores law applied to data the web has people spending more time online and leaving a trail of data wherever they go mobile applications leave an even richer data trail since many of them are annotated with geolocation or involve video or audio all of which can be mined pointofsale devices and frequentshoppers cards make it possible to capture all of your retail transactions not just the ones you make online all of this data would be useless if we couldnt store it and thats where moores law comes in since the early 80s processor speed has increased from 10 mhz to 36 ghz  an increase of 360 not counting increases in word length and number of cores but weve seen much bigger increases in storage capacity on every level ram has moved from 1000mb to roughly 25gb  a price reduction of about 40000 to say nothing of the reduction in size and increase in speed hitachi made the first gigabyte disk drives in 1982 weighing in at roughly 250 pounds now terabyte drives are consumer equipment and a 32 gb microsd card weighs about half a gram whether you look at bits per gram bits per dollar or raw capacity storage has more than kept pace with the increase of cpu speed the importance of moores law as applied to data isnt just geek pyrotechnics data expands to fill the space you have to store it the more storage is available the more data you will find to put into it the data exhaust you leave behind whenever you surf the web friend someone on facebook or make a purchase in your local supermarket is all carefully collected and analyzed increased storage capacity demands increased sophistication in the analysis and use of that data thats the foundation of data science so how do we make that data useful the first step of any data analysis project is data conditioning or getting data into a state where its usable we are seeing more data in formats that are easier to consume atom data feeds web services microformats and other newer technologies provide data in formats thats directly machineconsumable but oldstyle screen scraping hasnt died and isnt going to die many sources of wild data are extremely messy they arent wellbehaved xml files with all the metadata nicely in place the foreclosure data used in data mashups in r was posted on a public website by the philadelphia county sheriffs office this data was presented as an html file that was probably generated automatically from a spreadsheet if youve ever seen the html thats generated by excel you know thats going to be fun to process data conditioning can involve cleaning up messy html with tools like beautiful soup  natural language processing to parse plain text in english and other languages or even getting humans to do the dirty work youre likely to be dealing with an array of data sources all in different forms it would be nice if there was a standard set of tools to do the job but there isnt to do data conditioning you have to be ready for whatever comes and be willing to use anything from ancient unix utilities such as awk to xml parsers and machine learning libraries scripting languages such as perl and python  are essential once youve parsed the data you can start thinking about the quality of your data data is frequently missing or incongruous if data is missing do you simply ignore the missing points that isnt always possible if data is incongruous do you decide that something is wrong with badly behaved data after all equipment fails or that the incongruous data is telling its own story which may be more interesting its reported that the discovery of ozone layer depletion was delayed because automated data collection tools discarded readings that were too low  1  in data science what you have is frequently all youre going to get its usually impossible to get better data and you have no alternative but to work with the data at hand if the problem involves human language understanding the data adds another dimension to the problem roger magoulas who runs the data analysis group at oreilly was recently searching a database for apple job listings requiring geolocation skills while that sounds like a simple task the trick was disambiguating apple from many job postings in the growing apple industry to do it well you need to understand the grammatical structure of a job posting you need to be able to parse the english and that problem is showing up more and more frequently try using google trends to figure out whats happening with the cassandra database or the python language and youll get a sense of the problem google has indexed many many websites about large snakes disambiguation is never an easy task but tools like the natural language toolkit library can make it simpler when natural language processing fails you can replace artificial intelligence with human intelligence thats where services like amazons mechanical turk come in if you can split your task up into a large number of subtasks that are easily described you can use mechanical turks marketplace for cheap labor for example if youre looking at job listings and want to know which originated with apple you can have real people do the classification for roughly 001 each if you have already reduced the set to 10000 postings with the word apple paying humans 001 to classify them only costs 100 working with data at scale weve all heard a lot about big data but big is really a red herring oil companies telecommunications companies and other datacentric industries have had huge datasets for a long time and as storage capacity continues to expand todays big is certainly tomorrows medium and next weeks small the most meaningful definition ive heard big data is when the size of the data itself becomes part of the problem  were discussing data problems ranging from gigabytes to petabytes of data at some point traditional techniques for working with data run out of steam what are we trying to do with data thats different according to jeff hammerbacher 2  hackingdata  were trying to build information platforms or dataspaces information platforms are similar to traditional data warehouses but different they expose rich apis and are designed for exploring and understanding the data rather than for traditional analysis and reporting they accept all data formats including the most messy and their schemas evolve as the understanding of the data changes most of the organizations that have built data platforms have found it necessary to go beyond the relational database model traditional relational database systems stop being effective at this scale managing sharding and replication across a horde of database servers is difficult and slow the need to define a schema in advance conflicts with reality of multiple unstructured data sources in which you may not know whats important until after youve analyzed the data relational databases are designed for consistency to support complex transactions that can easily be rolled back if any one of a complex set of operations fails while rocksolid consistency is crucial to many applications its not really necessary for the kind of analysis were discussing here do you really care if you have 1010 or 1012 twitter followers precision has an allure but in most datadriven applications outside of finance that allure is deceptive most data analysis is comparative if youre asking whether sales to northern europe are increasing faster than sales to southern europe you arent concerned about the difference between 592 percent annual growth and 593 percent to store huge datasets effectively weve seen a new breed of databases appear these are frequently called nosql databases or nonrelational databases though neither term is very useful they group together fundamentally dissimilar products by telling you what they arent many of these databases are the logical descendants of googles bigtable and amazons dynamo  and are designed to be distributed across many nodes to provide eventual consistency but not absolute consistency and to have very flexible schema while there are two dozen or so products available almost all of them open source a few leaders have established themselves cassandra  developed at facebook in production use at twitter rackspace reddit and other large sites cassandra is designed for high performance reliability and automatic replication it has a very flexible data model a new startup riptano  provides commercial support hbase  part of the apache hadoop project and modelled on googles bigtable suitable for extremely large databases billions of rows millions of columns distributed across thousands of nodes along with hadoop commercial support is provided by cloudera  storing data is only part of building a data platform though data is only useful if you can do something with it and enormous datasets present computational problems google popularized the mapreduce approach which is basically a divideandconquer strategy for distributing an extremely large problem across an extremely large computing cluster in the map stage a programming task is divided into a number of identical subtasks which are then distributed across many processors the intermediate results are then combined by a single reduce task in hindsight mapreduce seems like an obvious solution to googles biggest problem creating large searches its easy to distribute a search across thousands of processors and then combine the results into a single set of answers whats less obvious is that mapreduce has proven to be widely applicable to many large data problems ranging from search to machine learning the most popular open source implementation of mapreduce is the hadoop project  yahoos claim that they had built the worlds largest production hadoop application  with 10000 cores running linux brought it onto center stage many of the key hadoop developers have found a home at cloudera  which provides commercial support amazons elastic mapreduce makes it much easier to put hadoop to work without investing in racks of linux machines by providing preconfigured hadoop images for its ec2 clusters you can allocate and deallocate processors as needed paying only for the time you use them hadoop goes far beyond a simple mapreduce implementation of which there are several its the key component of a data platform it incorporates hdfs  a distributed filesystem designed for the performance and reliability requirements of huge datasets the hbase database hive  which lets developers explore hadoop datasets using sqllike queries a highlevel dataflow language called pig  and other components if anything can be called a onestop information platform hadoop is it hadoop has been instrumental in enabling agile data analysis in software development agile practices are associated with faster product cycles closer interaction between developers and consumers and testing traditional data analysis has been hampered by extremely long turnaround times if you start a calculation it might not finish for hours or even days but hadoop and particularly elastic mapreduce make it easy to build clusters that can perform computations on long datasets quickly faster computations make it easier to test different assumptions different datasets and different algorithms its easer to consult with clients to figure out whether youre asking the right questions and its possible to pursue intriguing possibilities that youd otherwise have to drop for lack of time hadoop is essentially a batch system but hadoop online prototype hop is an experimental project that enables stream processing hadoop processes data as it arrives and delivers intermediate results in near realtime near realtime data analysis enables features like trending topics on sites like twitter  these features only require soft realtime reports on trending topics dont require millisecond accuracy as with the number of followers on twitter a trending topics report only needs to be current to within five minutes  or even an hour according to hilary mason  hmason  data scientist at bitly  its possible to precompute much of the calculation then use one of the experiments in realtime mapreduce to get presentable results machine learning is another essential tool for the data scientist we now expect web and mobile applications to incorporate recommendation engines and building a recommendation engine is a quintessential artificial intelligence problem you dont have to look at many modern web applications to see classification error detection image matching behind google goggles and snaptell  and even face detection  an illadvised mobile application lets you take someones picture with a cell phone and look up that persons identity using photos available online andrew ngs machine learning course is one of the most popular courses in computer science at stanford with hundreds of students  this video is highly recommended  there are many libraries available for machine learning pybrain in python elefant  weka in java and mahout coupled to hadoop google has just announced their prediction api  which exposes their machine learning algorithms for public use via a restful interface for computer vision the opencv library is a defacto standard mechanical turk is also an important part of the toolbox machine learning almost always requires a training set or a significant body of known data with which to develop and tune the application the turk is an excellent way to develop training sets once youve collected your training data perhaps a large collection of public photos from twitter you can have humans classify them inexpensively  possibly sorting them into categories possibly drawing circles around faces cars or whatever interests you its an excellent way to classify a few thousand data points at a cost of a few cents each even a relatively large job only costs a few hundred dollars while i havent stressed traditional statistics building statistical models plays an important role in any data analysis according to mike driscoll  dataspora  statistics is the grammar of data science it is crucial to making data speak coherently weve all heard the joke that eating pickles causes death because everyone who dies has eaten pickles that joke doesnt work if you understand what correlation means more to the point its easy to notice that one advertisement for r in a nutshell generated 2 percent more conversions than another but it takes statistics to know whether this difference is significant or just a random fluctuation data science isnt just about the existence of data or making guesses about what that data might mean its about testing hypotheses and making sure that the conclusions youre drawing from the data are valid statistics plays a role in everything from traditional business intelligence bi to understanding how googles ad auctions work statistics has become a basic skill it isnt superseded by newer techniques from machine learning and other disciplines it complements them while there are many commercial statistical packages the open source r language and its comprehensive package library cran is an essential tool although r is an odd and quirky language particularly to someone with a background in computer science it comes close to providing one stop shopping for most statistical work it has excellent graphics facilities cran includes parsers for many kinds of data and newer extensions extend r into distributed computing if theres a single tool that provides an endtoend solution for statistics work r is it making data tell its story a picture may or may not be worth a thousand words but a picture is certainly worth a thousand numbers the problem with most data analysis algorithms is that they generate a set of numbers to understand what the numbers mean the stories they are really telling you need to generate a graph edward tuftes visual display of quantitative information is the classic for data visualization and a foundational text for anyone practicing data science but thats not really what concerns us here visualization is crucial to each stage of the data scientist according to martin wattenberg  wattenberg  founder of flowing media  visualization is key to data conditioning if you want to find out just how bad your data is try plotting it visualization is also frequently the first step in analysis hilary mason says that when she gets a new data set she starts by making a dozen or more scatter plots trying to get a sense of what might be interesting once youve gotten some hints at what the data might be saying you can follow it up with more detailed analysis there are many packages for plotting and presenting data gnuplot is very effective r incorporates a fairly comprehensive graphics package casey reas and ben frys processing is the state of the art particularly if you need to create animations that show how things change over time at ibms many eyes  many of the visualizations are fullfledged interactive applications nathan yaus flowingdata blog is a great place to look for creative visualizations one of my favorites is this animation of the growth of walmart over time and this is one place where art comes in not just the aesthetics of the visualization itself but how you understand it does it look like the spread of cancer throughout a body or the spread of a flu virus through a population making data tell its story isnt just a matter of presenting results it involves making connections then going back to other data sources to verify them does a successful retail chain spread like an epidemic and if so does that give us new insights into how economies work thats not a question we could even have asked a few years ago there was insufficient computing power the data was all locked up in proprietary sources and the tools for working with the data were insufficient its the kind of question we now ask routinely data scientists data science requires skills ranging from traditional computer science to mathematics to art describing the data science group he put together at facebook possibly the first data science group at a consumeroriented web property jeff hammerbacher said  on any given day a team member could author a multistage processing pipeline in python design a hypothesis test perform a regression analysis over data samples with r design and implement an algorithm for some dataintensive product or service in hadoop or communicate the results of our analyses to other members of the organization 3 where do you find the people this versatile according to dj patil chief scientist at linkedin  dpatil  the best data scientists tend to be hard scientists particularly physicists rather than computer science majors physicists have a strong mathematical background computing skills and come from a discipline in which survival depends on getting the most from the data they have to think about the big picture the big problem when youve just spent a lot of grant money generating data you cant just throw the data out if it isnt as clean as youd like you have to make it tell its story you need some creativity for when the story the data is telling isnt what you think its telling scientists also know how to break large problems up into smaller problems patil described the process of creating the group recommendation feature at linkedin it would have been easy to turn this into a highceremony development project that would take thousands of hours of developer time plus thousands of hours of computing time to do massive correlations across linkedins membership but the process worked quite differently it started out with a relatively small simple program that looked at members profiles and made recommendations accordingly asking things like did you go to cornell then you might like to join the cornell alumni group it then branched out incrementally in addition to looking at profiles linkedins data scientists started looking at events that members attended then at books members had in their libraries the result was a valuable data product that analyzed a huge database  but it was never conceived as such it started small and added value iteratively it was an agile flexible process that built toward its goal incrementally rather than tackling a huge mountain of data all at once this is the heart of what patil calls data jiujitsu  using smaller auxiliary problems to solve a large difficult problem that appears intractable cddb is a great example of data jiujitsu identifying music by analyzing an audio stream directly is a very difficult problem though not unsolvable  see midomi  for example but the cddb staff used data creatively to solve a much more tractable problem that gave them the same result computing a signature based on track lengths and then looking up that signature in a database is trivially simple hiring trends for data science its not easy to get a handle on jobs in data science however data from oreilly research shows a steady yearoveryear increase in hadoop and cassandra job listings which are good proxies for the data science market as a whole this graph shows the increase in cassandra jobs and the companies listing cassandra positions over time entrepreneurship is another piece of the puzzle patils first flippant answer to what kind of person are you looking for when you hire a data scientist was someone you would start a company with thats an important insight were entering the era of products that are built on data we dont yet know what those products are but we do know that the winners will be the people and the companies that find those products hilary mason came to the same conclusion her job as scientist at bitly is really to investigate the data that bitly is generating and find out how to build interesting products from it no one in the nascent data industry is trying to build the 2012 nissan stanza or office 2015 theyre all trying to find new products in addition to being physicists mathematicians programmers and artists theyre entrepreneurs data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience the willingness to build data products incrementally the ability to explore and the ability to iterate over a solution they are inherently interdiscplinary they can tackle all aspects of a problem from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions they can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem or to work with very broadly defined problems heres a lot of data what can you make from it the future belongs to the companies who figure out how to collect and use data successfully google amazon facebook and linkedin have all tapped into their datastreams and made that the core of their success they were the vanguard but newer companies like bitly are following their path whether its mining your personal biology building maps from the shared experience of millions of travellers or studying the urls that people pass to others the next generation of successful businesses will be built around data the part of hal varians quote that nobody remembers says it all  the ability to take data  to be able to understand it to process it to extract value from it to visualize it to communicate it  thats going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades data is indeed the new intel inside  oreilly publications related to data science r in a nutshell a quick and practical reference to learn what is becoming the standard for developing statistical software statistics in a nutshell an

layers of detail head first statistics this book teaches statistics through puzzles stories visual aids and realworld examples head first data analysis learn how to collect your data sort the distractions from the truth and find meaningful patterns  1 the nasa article denies this but also says that in 1984 they decided that the low values whch went back to the 70s were real whether humans or software decided to ignore anomalous data it appears that data was ignored 2 information platforms as dataspaces by jeff hammerbacher in beautiful data  3 information platforms as dataspaces by

already  i guess retweets are the new comments       joe     good post definitely where things are going i just wrote about this and related topics over the long weekend httpwwwjoeandmotorboatcom20100531beyondbigdata       robert richards     thanks for this post it might be useful to note that data science has been recognized as a discipline since at least 2001 that one of the first scholars to use data science in the sense used in this post was dr william s cleveland in his 2001 article data science an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics httpjmpa8mqep  that people working in this discipline have organized professional associations including codata the international council for science committee on data for science and technology httpwwwcodataorg  that there are conferences devoted to this discipline including the international codata conference httpwwwcodata2010com  and that there are journals that publish data science research including journal of data science httpwwwjdsonlinecom founded in 2003 and data science journal httpjmp9yyh5r founded in 2002       michael f martin     accountants are a kind of data scientist too       andrew walkingshaw     as one of the three founders of timetric  httptimetriccom  all of whom have a background in the physical sciences im biased but we couldnt agree more       alex tolley     good article  i do question the term data science as in data science enables the creation of data products   science is a process for discovering truth or at least discarding falsity  extracting information from data is more like cooking an art i also am a bit skeptical about the fetishizing of big data  certainly sometimes data sets are necessarily large but arguably better data acquired through better questions is preferable  a second best can be data sampling to reduce the analyzable data set to more tractable proportions  mining large data sets to death is very similar to spreadsheetitis that spread quickly in te 1980s once spreadsheets became widely available  nothing wrong with using spreadsheets except that they tended to focus attention on the questions where data that was available rather than the questions that really needed answers       brandyn     in hindsight mapreduce seems like an obvious solution to googles biggest problem creating large searches its easy to distribute a search across thousands of processors and then combine the results into a single set of answers you wouldnt use mapreduce like this in a lowlatency query situation  it is made for high throughput batch processing not quick turn around       joel     and still to date the best tool to mess around with large data sets is sas  been around for ages seems that as the web matures so too does the tool sets and methodologies it uses to extract value       rukmal fernando     great read on the subject of visualization stanfords protovis is also probably worthy of consideration httpvisstanfordeduprotovis ive only started trying it out but protovis is just javascript and svg and thats a big plus for me       kirk     thanks mike terabyte drives are consumer equipment are the cord wood to my campfire i want to know more about how video data is being analyzed does googles new machine transcription service change the game       brian ahier     this is the best post on data i have ever read i am stunned       ken     aw heck i hate to say this mike but data are not data is but despite my nitpicking this a good article       igor     great article please consider to include

best articles ive ever read data are our future jf       robert young     first or most recently at least yall made up web 20  now you make up data science if you want to create new information from existing read codd  thats what relations do as to r yes it is useful but sas still rules the job listings the explosion of text data distinct from audio video etc is wholly due to kiddies such as google who didnt want to build bcnf datastores because theyre the kiddies not the data just too dense  so they build using xml to compound the insult massively redundant flat files which in turn demand vast amounts of hdd and cpu to process  and they and you pat them on the back as being oh so clever  yikes the errors in the r and stat books are such to make it obvious your authors you too have an understanding of inferential statistics the only variety of any value about as deep as the iso9000 and six sigma folks  no that isnt an attaboy       michael r bernstein     the future belongs to the companies who figure out how to collect and use data successfully google amazon facebook and linkedin have all tapped into their datastreams and made that the core of their success also important is the ability to figure out how to tap into existing sources of data rather than collecting your own       eric christensen     data is cool  data science is cool  put out the feelers and collect more data figure out what to do with it later       muhammad mudssar     good article about data and its its importance specially importance of massive unstructured data the point is how one can get benefit from unstructured massive amount of data i think by using mapreduce one can find out the hidden patterns in unstructured data i think data along with better processing techniques is the future       marc     your graph of job listings vs time displays no indication of its vertical scale  does the maximum vertical point on the graph represent 3 listings or 300000 in an article on the importance of data that leaves me wondering how much of the content is hype and how much is well thought out       alan howlett aka technontologist     i see lots of commonality with richard saul wurmans definition of information architecture not the coopted web developer version information architect 1 the individual who organizes the patterns inherent in data making the complex clear 2 a person who creates the structure or map of information which allows others to find their personal paths to knowledge 3 the emerging 21st century professional occupation addressing the needs of the age focused upon clarity human understanding and the science of the organization of information technontologist       jorn bettin     very nice article however there is still a long way to go for data products the value of data analysis and representation critically depends on access to trustworthy source data quantification of trustworthiness is one of the harder problems for example the entire financial system hinges on trust and the level of trust in financial instruments is not known to be particularly stable manufacturing and publicising statements that are designed to influence the level of trust in financial instruments is an entire industry in its own right the article would be even better if it didnt contain simple calculation errors like ram has moved from 1000mb to roughly 25gb  a price reduction of about 4000 errors like this one have a direct impact on trustworthiness      httpradaroreillycommikel mike loukides     ouch  that arithmetic error really hurts thanks for pointing it outits been corrected the problem of trust is interesting  it depends to a large extent on the nature of the product we demand a different level of trust for financial products and that trust has obviously been shaken badly over the past two years than we do for facebook or linkedin recommendations  and youre right in finance theres a marketing industry thats designed to manufacture trust entirely aside from the quality of the data or the analysis       brian shaler     im going to cite the hell out of this article while a little scatterbrained it covers an amazingly broad array of subjects within the realm of data science the number of references  links to languages platformsframeworks tools and projects was very impressive thanks while all these hip new projects have been cropping up during the last five years were still at the beginning of this conversation im looking forward to seeing where the industry goes in the next five years and hope to play a part       brian shaler     i want to clarify on my last comment when i said all these i was not referring to all datarelated projects in general im aware that tools have been available to manipulate data for decades i probably should have phrased it more like with all these hip new projects cropping up        jessie wells     hi mike thanks for a really interesting article i think you mean that nasas data screening delayed discovery of ozone depletion as your links discuss not global warming the two physical phenomena are often confused but please dont further this problem they share the fact that their principal drivers are forms of pollution from human activities but they are not the same in their impacts or the actions needed to mitigate them recently a meteorological link was discovered whereby a the increased uvb radiation due to the depleted ozone layer does affect air circulation patterns in the antarctic but this is basically a reflection of the fact that almost any aspects of the earth system if you look hard enough      httpradaroreillycommikel mike loukides     im glad you liked the article  ive just fixed the reference to the ozone layer  thanks for pointing that out       megan     kudos for encouraging thoughtfulness about data and interdisciplinary approaches to data analysis problems  however i must make two points 1 actuarial science  statistics 2 for those commenting that this is the best article theyve read about data please allow me to introduce you to w edwards deming  httpenwikipediaorgwikiwedwardsdeming   statisticians have been thinking hard about data for many many years  lets not discard them with a flippant comment about actuaries and the false belief that anyone can run a few programs in r and correctly analyze data       g boyd     data science exists in order to usurp an individuals ooda loop without their knowledge as described by former air force pilot john boyd  of course data science is described as a sexy gig when youre bosses are control freaks it doesnt matter whether we get the image of the golden ring or the network centric system as both images represent identical ends       ben hoyle     great article in many ways data science and information engineering are synonymous both deal with a large amount of unstructured data and form conclusions inferences and predictions both can also be thought of as overlapping with ai and brain science what does the brain human fly etc do if not process lots of sensory data extremely cleverly we are reaching a stage where the great limiting factor to significant progress is our intelligent processing systems we are beginning to have the data but we dont yet have suitably developed systems to intelligently process that data both in a human and nonhuman manner       g boyd     ben hoyle first information engineering is a means to an end this end which can be referred to as social engineering or the designing of society and its participants  usurp ones observe and orient functions in their closedloop decision processes and you can then predict an individuals decide and act part of the loop as described by john boyd second of course we have or will soon have the algorithms available to process this data  what do you think intent harvesting and intent generation is about  this is facebooks play in the display advertising game with their launch of the i like feature  were talking about generating individual profiles on the feedback side of the loop such that controls can be implemented on other half of the loop loss of privacy and the simultaneous rise of data engineering is no accident  all these moves are driven by the goal of usurping ones ooda loop  do that across enough people in the public domain and guess what you have now why is oreilly et all not discussing this critical aspect of the technologies and strategies that are being pushed on to the tech community for deployment tell us its not relevant doesnt cut it       m s prasad     great knowledge filled  post and  good coverage of tehnology data science  as i understand  has been a forte of  statistics   mathematicians  for long  we converted it as a formidable tool and gave a face to understand it  better by  users something like putting  relativity theory in simple  words eg linux for dummies  information engineering is a process to extract the useful knowledge or result from a set of information  which can be data  and sometime intangibles also or perceived ones as far image data sets are concerned  being  multidimensional  has a total mathematical basis for its processing  and result  retrievals just my  thoughts i have posted this article  on cloud secuirty alliance  group in linked in thanks       torrance s     an incredibly well written article       martin king     there are many aspects to science much of it consists of the daily grind with data and the tools of science i think we need to be careful not to lose sight of the drivers of science and where much of science comes from  intuition and great ideas  after which we create experiments to test hypotheses which inevitably involve data of some kind       jewel ward     i would add to this list of aspects of data science the ability to determine the best way to migrate store  archive data as well as whether or not to keep it storage is indeed cheap and getting cheaper but given petabytes or yottabytes of data if you arent using 90 of what you are storing does it make sense to keep paying to store migrate etc the data barring legal requirements to do so think in terms of the larger scale of it  the electricity required both in generating the electricity itself  paying for use plus the machines that must be purchased and the humans who must be paid to manage the data through its lifecycle costbenefit analysis is an important component having said that this is a great article       fred beringer     excellent article and a good summary of where data is headed on the where data comes from you dont mentions the opendata movement im mentioning in my article about the future of data and predictive analytics  httpwwwfredberingercommusingsonthefutureofdataandpredictiveanalytics3  i hope this movement will play a big role in the future as there is so much benefits to leverage data from the public and private sectors another source of data you briefly mentions are the millions of sensors were going to see in our life in the next 510 years with the so called internet of things this is really getting real   httpwwwfredberingercomistheinternetofthingsreadyforprimetime  weve havent seen anything yet  fred       leo irakliotis     as i keel reading and reading the article the academic inside me keeps repeating the same question do we academics do a good or even adequate job at educating future data scientists  should we consider creating data science programs  what can we do to offer better more relevant education to individuals who may be pursuing or using data science  and who can possibly advise us about the practical realities of data science       vassilis nikolopoulos     excellent article on new data management trends traditional approaches to db and storage  analytics have to be changed in order to cope with this huge evolution on data and stream decision analysis olap bi and traditional data mining have to be updated with new rd tips       david alan christopher     fascinating article mike im a librarian and our lot faces a handful of data as well weve been writing some java and ruby code lately for inhouse data analysis and even some basic segmentation of our huge inventory we often need to pull content from external public websites usually government and npos which dont have any form of exportable data formats weve started using a tool called feedity httpfeeditycom for that purpose so far its worked out pretty well as weve been able to scrape raw data as structured information from hundreds of public sources i bet this space will only grow as data becomes more and more important for organizations worldwide       ellen oneal     this stuff fascinates me i love the examples of facebook linkedin and amazon using patterns to suggest other relationships and cross sell another example that comes to mind is pandora a friend of mine wrote an article that

httpindustrialengineertoolsblogspotcom larry ieor tools     this is a great article about how getting information from data is going to be so important in the future  ive been writing about this for years  i love how data science is really taking on a life of its own now      httpwwwadaptiveprocesscom max j pucher  chief architect isis papyrus software     mike great research on a relevant subject let me however add that much of the data that is collected is irrelevant cddb is a great success because their data model is simple and the data are really very limited a few million rows filtering the relevant stuff is not easy and mostly an intuitive human skill as long as the model can be grasped statistical processing does however not replicate reality but is always built on a model illusion dont forget that all models are wrong but some are useful einstein further it depends how the data is collected how it is timed how accurate it is how it is filtered which questions were asked or points that were measured and a few more elements that rely on model assumption statistics further only produce correlation but not causation humans tend to misinterpret many effects as causes because the effect can be seen while the cause doesnt exist as a singular event but is a complex web if feeding stimuli that need a complex web of receptive context to actually make something happen ie bringing a pot of water to boil is not caused by switching on the stove think of all the other causal elements that are needed including air pressure and saline content all human activity cannot be causally interpreted because social activity must be seen as complex adaptive systems that undergo continuous change that is hardly ever reflected in the data model and processing which is why managing a business with bpm workflows and predictive analytics is for idiots who dont understand nature and science they look for predictability where there is none the models of global warming and climate change are complete rubbish and so will be many of the data models that try to make sense of all the random data collected yes some of it will be useful as an aha moment but it certainly wont predict the future or allow us to control things better and if that isnt possible why bother i wont even go into the already mentioned issues of privacy and misuse of the collected data by governments and big business      httpattorneydirectoryofamericacom attorney     while data science is incredibly beneficial and helping to improve the standard of living of humanity im not so sure that i go so far as to agree with hal varian that statistics is the next sexy job thats a bit of a stretch important absolutely sexy well great post by the way jim

than the real world phenomena it describes data is still conventionally seen as something than describes something else and so not the atomic thing itself but that may change so that the data itself

aS'       rarefied talent in big data technology and analytics     post jobs  employer login              home    data science jobs  analytics     data technology jobs     about datajobscom     big data knowledge repo     what is data science  what is analytics what is a data scientist    posted by frank lo      we have lots of data  now what  how can we unlock valuable insight from our data    data science is deep knowledge discovery through data inference and exploration this discipline often involves using mathematic and algorithmic techniques to solve some of the most analytically complex business problems leveraging troves of raw information to figure out hidden insight that lies beneath the surface it centers around evidencebased analytical rigor and building robust decision capabilities  ultimately data science matters because it enables companies to operate and strategize more intelligently  it is all about adding substantial enterprise value by learning from data     the variety of projects that a data scientist may be engaged in is incredibly broad here are few examples   tactical optimization improvement of marketing campaigns business processes etc  predictive analytics anticipate future demand future events etc  nuanced learning eg developing deep understanding of consumer behavior  recommendation engines eg amazon product recs netflix movie recs  automated decision engines eg automated fraud detection and even selfdriving cars   the objectives of these types of initiatives may be clear but the problems require extensive quantitative expertise to solve they may require building predictive models attribution models segmentation models heuristics for deep patterndiscovery in data etc  this commands having exhaustive knowledge of all sorts of machinelearning algorithms and sharp technical ability as you might guess these are not the easiest skills to pick up   what is data science  the requisite skill set  data science is multidisciplinary the skill set of a data scientist lies at the intersection of 3 main competencies      mathematics expertise   at the heart of deriving insight from data is the ability to view the data through a quantitative lens there are textures patterns dimensions and correlations in data that can be expressed numerically and discovering inference from data becomes a brain teaser of mathematical techniques solutions to many business problems often involve building analytic models that are deeply grounded in the hard math theory and being able to understand how models work is as important as knowing the process to build them  danger of building without knowing the math    beware of people who know just enough to build a model but dont fully understand the mechanics of how the model works this can easily end up with misuse of algorithms misinterpretation of results and misleading insight which can steer a business in the wrong direction   also a big misconception is that data science all about statistics while statistics are important it is not the only type of mathematics that should be wellunderstood by a data scientist first there are two main branches of statistics classical statistics and bayesian statistics  when most people refer to stats they are generally referring to classical stats  but knowledge of both types is very helpful furthermore many inferential techniques and machine learning algorithms lean heavily on knowledge of linear algebra  for example key data science processes like svd used for dimension reduction  latent variable discovery are grounded in matrix mathematics and have much less to do with classical statistics overall data scientists should have substantial breadth and depth in their knowledge of math   technology and hacking   first lets clarify on that we are not talking about hacking as in breaking into computers were referring to the techdeveloper subculture meaning of hacking ie creativity and ingenuity in using technical skills to build things and find clever solutions to problems  why is hacking ability important because data scientists absolutely need to leverage technology in order to wrangle enormous data sets and work with complex algorithms and it requires using tools far more sophisticated than excel examples of such tools are sql  sas  and r  all of which require technicalcoding ability with these highperformance tools a true hacker is a technical ninja able to use ingenious problem solving ability to achieve mastery in data exploration  piecing together unstructured information and teasing out golden nuggets of insight  another way to define a hacker is as a solid algorithmic thinker that is having the ability to break down messy problems and recompose them in ways that are solvable this is critical for good data science especially since data scientists work intimately within existing algorithmic frameworks and oftentimes create their own algorithms to solve complex problems clarity of thinking within deeplyabstract mental maps of data dimensions and processing capability is how challenging problems get solved   strong business acumen   it is very important to note that a data scientist is first and foremost a strategy consultant  data science teams have become invaluable resources within companies because by being able to learn from data in ways no one else can they are extraordinarily wellpositioned to figure out how to add substantial business value but this means having a keen sense of how to dissect and approach business problems becomes as important as having a keen sense of how to approach algorithmic problems ultimately the value doesnt come from numbers it comes from strategic thinking based on those numbers  additionally a core competency of data science is in using data to cogently tell a story this means no datapuking rather presenting a cohesive narrative of problem and solution using data insights as supporting pillars that lead to guidance  clearly get all the competencies right  math technology and business  and this is an incredibly potent combination there is a reason why data scientists are well paid and probably will never have to worry about job security not a bad place to be to have the rarefied talents that big companies everywhere are trying to recruit    what is a data scientist  curiosity and training   the mindset   a defining personality trait of data scientists is they are deep thinkers with intense intellectual curiosity  data science is all about being inquisitive  asking new questions making new discoveries and learning new things ask true data scientists what drives them in their job and they will not say  money   the real motivator is being able to use their creativity and ingenuity to solve hard problems and constantly indulge in their curiosity deriving insight from data is not about getting an answer it is about uncovering  truth  that lies hidden beneath the surface problem solving is not a task but rather an intellectuallystimulating journey to a solution there is passion for the work and great satisfaction in taking on challenge   training   while solid math skills are necessary there is a glaring misconception out there that you need a phd in statistics to become a legitimate data scientist that view completely misses the point that data science is multidisciplinary years of study in academia may not leave graduates with the correct set of experience and abilities to excel  ie a phd statistician may not have nimble hacking skills or strategic business intuition to complete the trifecta  as a matter of fact data science is such a relatively new and rising discipline that universities have not caught up in developing comprehensive data science degree programs  meaning that no one can really claim to have  done all the schooling  to be become a data scientist where does much of the training come from the unyielding intellectual curiosity that data scientists possess drive them to be passionate autodidacts  motivated to learn skills on their own with deep determination  read where can you find people like this    analytics and machine learning  how it ties to data science  there are a slew of terms closely related to data science that we hope to add some clarity around   what is analytics   analytics has risen quickly in popular business lingo over the past several years the term is used loosely but generally meant to describe critical thinking that is quantitative in nature technically analytics is the  science of analysis  put another way the practice of analyzing information to make decisions  is  analytics  the same thing as data science depends on context sometimes it is synonymous with the definition of data science that we have described and sometimes it represents something else a data scientist using raw data to build a predictive behavior model falls into the scope of analytics at the same time a general business user interpreting prebuilt dashboard reports eg ga  is also in the realm of analytics but does not cross into the specialized skill needed in data science analytics has come to have fairly broad meaning though at the end of the day the semantics dont matter much    what is the difference between an analyst and a data scientist     analyst  is somewhat of an ambiguous term that can represent many different types of roles marketing analyst operations analyst portfolio analyst financial analyst etc is an analyst the same as a data scientist weve discussed pretty strict canon around what is a data scientist  as an experts role with requisite talents in math technology and strategy consulting lets just say that some analysts are definitely datascientistsintraining as represented in this visual there is a place in the middle where the distinction can blur a bit  here are examples of growth from analyst to veritable data scientist   an analyst who has previously only mastered excel learns how to dive into raw warehouse data using sql and r  an analyst who previously only knew enough stats to report the results of an ab test gains the expertise to build a predictive model with latent variable analysis and crossvalidation   overall point is that moving in the direction of  data scientist  requires motivation to learn many new skills many companies have actually found success cultivating their own homegrown data scientists by giving their analysts the resources and training to take their abilities to the next level   what is machine learning   machine learning is a term that is closely tied to data science simply it means being able to train systems or algorithms to derive insight from a data set the actual types of machine learning are varied ranging from regression models to support vector machines to neural nets but it all centers around  teaching  a computer to become very good at pattern recognition examples of machine learning include   predictive models that can anticipate user behavior  clustering algorithms that mine for natural similarities between different customers  classification models that can recognize and filter out spam  recommendation engines that  learn  about preferences at an individual level  neural nets that can recognize what image patterns look like   data scientists work intimately with machine learning techniques to build algorithms that automate elements of their problemsolving it is a requisite part of the data science toolset needed to tackle some of the most complex datadriven projects   what is data munging   raw data can be unstructured and messy with information from disparate data sources and mismatched records data munging is a term to describe the important process of cleaning up data so that it is ready for data analysis and use in machine learning algorithms this requires good patternrecognition ability and clever hacking skills in order to merge and transform masses of raw information dirty data can obfuscate the  truth  hidden in the data and completely mislead an analysis thus any data scientist must be skillful and nimble at data munging in order to have accurate data for deriving insight  final word  in any organization that wants to leverage big data to gain value data science is the secret sauce but it is incredibly difficult to find experts who embody all the necessary talents  so if you manage to hire a data scientist nurture them keep them engaged and give them autonomy to be their own architects in figuring out how to add value to the business at the end of the day data science is a capability that turns information to gold and data scientists are uniquely positioned to be transformative figures within a company          tweet         post or tweet this article

aS'                       home data science services blog about               home  what is data science   what is data science  theories behind data science if youd like to perform data science there are several theories and principles that you need to understand  and once you understand these theories and principles it will allow you to learn a certain set of practices and step by step skills that data scientists do  if you dont understand these theories and principles then you wont be able to understand the practices and skills  so first let me teach you a few theories and principles that are involved and once you understand the theoretical elements then i can teach you a simple stepbystep method for doing data science database theory firstly lets talk about database theory  database theory is about organising data and organising it in a way that makes storing and retrieving it efficient  data can be categorised into objects objects can be put into collections and objects and collections can have relationships between each other and themselves  the one thing you need to know about this theory is that they way you organise your data will impact the effort required to get answers from it agile manifesto now lets talk about the agile manifesto  the agile manifesto is a set of principles that ensures high quality outputs in environments subject to high levels of change and ambiguity  agile methods overcome rapid changes and ambiguity through adopting an iterative development process  it utilises self managed teams and those that are passionate about technological advancements are drawn to it like scientists to big bang theory  the agile manifesto looks to remove all cultural barriers between developer client and end user and focuses on using the latest technology to making things simple but not simpler  the one thing you need to know about this set of principles is that all things change and the longer you take to test your solution in the live environment the higher the risk of failure spiral dynamics the last theory id like to touch on is spiral dynamics theory  spiral dynamics is a theory of human development and behaviour and explains why humans do what we do  it explains the psychology behind why we get out of bed in the morning  why we feel compelled to create things and why we seek to better ourselves and better serve our loved ones  the theory talks about two mental states one of facts and one of values  facts are what we believe  our beliefs are based on the knowledge we currently have and the environment we are currently in  values are what we desire  our desires are driven by our intentions andor concerns which are also based on the knowledge we currently have and the environment we are currently in  the one thing you need to know about this theory is that our facts and our desires come from what data is presented to us data scientists data scientists perform data science  they use technology and skills to increase awareness clarity and direction for those working with data  the data scientist role is here to accommodate the rapid changes that occur in our modern day environment and are bestowed the task of minimising the disruption that technology and data is having on the way we work play and learn  data scientists dont just present data data scientists present data with an intelligence awareness of the consequences of presenting that data how to do data science the three components involved in data science are organising packaging and delivering data the opd of data  organising is where the physical location and structure of the data is planned and executed  packaging is where the prototypes are build the statistics is performed and the visualisation is created  delivering is where the story gets told and the value is obtained  however what separates data science from all other existing roles is that they also need to have a continual awareness of what how who and why  a data scientist needs to know what will be the output of the data science process and have a clear vision of this output  a data scientist needs to have a clearly defined plan on how will this output be achieved within the restraints of available resources and time  a data scientist needs to deeply understand who the people are that will be involved in creating the output  and most of all the data scientist must know why there is a motivation behind attempting to manifest the creative visualisation the 3 step opd data science process step 1 organise data organising data involves the physical storage and format of data and incorporated best practices in data management step 2 package data  packaging data involves logically manipulating and joining the underlying raw data into a new representation and package step 3 deliver data delivering data involves ensuring that the message the data has is being accessed by those that need to hear it plus at all steps have answers to these questions  what is being created  how will it be created  who will be involved in creating it  why is it to be created the data science model data science in action data science in action it is simply about moving people andor systems between current and new technologies and between beginner and expert skills step 1 organising data organising data involves moving people and systems from current to new left to right and from beginner to expert top to bottom  advancing technologies and skills is the essence of innovation step 2 packaging data packaging data is the reverse of organising data and involves moving people and systems from new to current right to left and from expert to beginner bottom to top  this is the art of making things simple but not simpler step 3 delivering data delivering data is enabling the movement from one view to another enabling a beginner to become an expert enabling current technology to seem new enabling expert data to be understood by beginners and enabling new technology to seem like it has be a part of your life since you were born  this is transformational education tweet          links list  home data science services blog about    subscribe

unfollow comments             the story of how data scientists became sexy is mostly the story of the coupling of the mature discipline of statistics with a very young onecomputer science  the term data science has emerged only recently to specifically designate a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data but making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists statisticians librarians computer scientists and others for years the following timeline traces the evolution of the term data science and its use attempts to define it and related terms   1962 john w tukey writes in the future of data analysis  for a long time i thought i was a statistician interested in inferences from the particular to the general but as i have watched mathematical statistics evolve i have had cause to wonder and doubt i have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis  data analysis and the parts of statistics which adhere to it musttake on the characteristics of science rather than those of mathematics data analysis is intrinsically an empirical science how vital and how important is the rise of the storedprogram electronic computer in many instances the answer may surprise many by being important but not vital although in others there is no doubt but what the computer has been vital in 1947 tukey coined the term bit which claude shannon used in his 1948 paper a mathematical theory of communications in 1977 tukey published exploratory data analysis  arguing that more emphasis needed to be placed on using data to suggest hypotheses to test and that exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis canand shouldproceed side by side   1974 peter naur publishes concise survey of computer methods in sweden and the united states the book is a survey of contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications it is organized around the concept of data as defined in the ifip guide to concepts and terms in data processing  data is a representation of facts or ideas in a formalized manner capable of being communicated or manipulated by some process the preface to the book tells the reader that a course plan was presented at the ifip congress in 1968 titled datalogy the science of data and of data processes and its place in education and that in the text of the book the term data science has been used freely naur offers the following definition of data science the science of dealing with data once they have been established while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences  1977  the international association for statistical computing iasc is established as a section of the isi  it is the mission of the iasc to link traditional statistical methodology modern computer technology and the knowledge of domain experts in order to convert data into information and knowledge     1989 gregory piatetskyshapiro organizes and chairs the first knowledge discovery in databases kdd workshop  in 1995  it became the annual acm sigkdd conference on knowledge discovery and data mining kdd  september 1994  businessweek publishes a cover story on database marketing  companies are collecting mountains of information about you crunching it to predict how likely you are to buy a product and using that knowledge to craft a marketing message precisely calibrated to get you to do so  an earlier flush of enthusiasm prompted by the spread of checkout scanners in the 1980s ended in widespread disappointment many companies were too overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of data to do anything useful with the information still many companies believe they have no choice but to brave the databasemarketing frontier  1996 members of the international federation of classification societies  ifcs meet in kobe japan for their biennial conference for the first time the term data science is included in the title of the conference data science classification and related methods the ifcs was founded in 1985 by six country and languagespecific classification societies one of which the classification society  was founded in 1964 the classification societies have variously used the terms data analysis data mining and data science in their publications     1996 usama fayyad gregory piatetskyshapiro and padhraic smyth publish from data mining to knowledge discovery in databases  they write historically the notion of finding useful patterns in data has been given a variety of names including data mining knowledge extraction information discovery information harvesting data archeology and data pattern processing in our view kdd knowledge discovery in databases refers to the overall process of discovering useful knowledge from data and data mining refers to a particular step in this process data mining is the application of specific algorithms for extracting patterns from data the additional steps in the kdd process such as data preparation data selection data cleaning incorporation of appropriate prior knowledge and proper interpretation of the results of mining are essential to ensure that useful knowledge is derived from the data blind application of datamining methods rightly criticized as data dredging in the statistical literature can be a dangerous activity easily leading to the discovery of meaningless and invalid patterns  1997 in his inaugural lecture for the h c carver chair in statistics at the university of michigan professor c f jeff wu currently at the georgia institute of technology  calls for statistics to be renamed data science and statisticians to be renamed data scientists  1997 the journal data mining and knowledge discovery is launched the reversal of the order of the two terms in its title reflecting the ascendance of data mining as the more popular way to designate extracting information from large databases  december 1999 jacob zahavi is quoted in mining data for nuggets of knowledge in knowledgewharton conventional statistical methods work well with small data sets todays databases however can involve millions of rows and scores of columns of data scalability is a huge issue in data mining another technical challenge is developing models that can do a better job analyzing data detecting nonlinear relationships and interaction between elements special data mining tools may have to be developed to address website decisions  2001 william s cleveland publishes data science an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics  it is a plan to enlarge the major areas of technical work of the field of statistics because the plan is ambitious and implies substantial change the altered field will be called data science cleveland puts the proposed new discipline in the context of computer science and the contemporary work in data mining the benefit to the data analyst has been limited because the knowledge among computer scientists about how to think of and approach the analysis of data is limited just as the knowledge of computing environments by statisticians is limited a merger of knowledge bases would produce a powerful force for innovation this suggests that statisticians should look to computing for knowledge today just as data science looked to mathematics in the past  departments of data science should contain faculty members who devote their careers to advances in computing with data and who form partnership with computer scientists  2001 leo breiman publishes statistical modeling the two cultures  pdf  there are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data one assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model the other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown the statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models this commitment has led to irrelevant theory questionable conclusions and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems algorithmic modeling both in theory and practice has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics it can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets if our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools  april 2002 launch of data science journal  publishing papers on the management of data and databases in science and technology the scope of the journal includes descriptions of data systems their publication on the internet applications and legal issues the journal is published by the committee on data for science and technology  codata  of the international council for science icsu  january 2003 launch of journal of data science  by data science we mean almost everything that has something to do with data collecting analyzing modeling yet the most important part is its applicationsall sorts of applications this journal is devoted to applications of statistical methods at large the journal of data science will provide a platform for all data workers to present their views and exchange ideas  may 2005 thomas h davenport don cohen and al jacobson publish competing on analytics  a babson college working knowledge research center report describing the emergence of a new form of competition based on the extensive use of analytics data and factbased decision making instead of competing on traditional factors companies are beginning to employ statistical and quantitative analysis and predictive modeling as primary elements of competition  the research is later published by davenport in the harvard business review january 2006 and is expanded with jeanne g harris into the book competing on analytics  the new science of winning  march 2007  september 2005  the national science board publishes longlived digital data collections enabling research and education in the 21 st century  one of the recommendations of the report reads the nsf working in partnership with collection managers and the community at large should act to develop and mature the career path for data scientists and to ensure that the research enterprise includes a sufficient number of highquality data scientists the report defines data scientists as the information and computer scientists database and software engineers and programmers disciplinary experts curators and expert annotators librarians archivists and others who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection  2007 the research center for dataology and data science is established at fudan university shanghai china  in 2009 two of the centers researchers yangyong zhu and yun xiong publish introduction to dataology and data science  in which they state different from natural science and social science dataology and data science takes data in cyberspace as its research object it is a new science  the center holds annual symposiums on dataology and data science   july 2008 the jisc publishes the final report of a study it commissioned to examine and make recommendations on the role and career development of data scientists and the associated supply of specialist data curation skills to the research community  the studys final report the skills role  career structure of data scientists  curators  assessment of current practice  future needs  defines data scientists as people who work where the research is carried outor in the case of data centre personnel in close collaboration with the creators of the dataand may be involved in creative enquiry and analysis enabling others to work with digital data and developments in data base technology  january 2009  harnessing the power of digital data for science and society is published this report of the interagency working group on digital data to the committee on science of the national science and technology council states that the nation needs to identify and promote the emergence of new disciplines and specialists expert in addressing the complex and dynamic challenges of digital preservation sustained access reuse and repurposing of data many disciplines are seeing the emergence of a new type of data science and management expert accomplished in the computer information and data sciences arenas and in another domain science these individuals are key to the current and future success of the scientific enterprise however these individuals often receive little recognition for their contributions and have limited career paths  january 2009 hal varian googles chief economist tells the mckinsey quarterly  i keep saying the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians people think im joking but who wouldve guessed that computer engineers wouldve been the sexy job of the 1990s the ability to take datato be able to understand it to process it to extract value from it to visualize it to communicate itthats going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades because now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data so the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it i do think those skillsof being able to access understand and communicate the insights you get from data analysisare going to be extremely important managers need to be able to access and understand the

have been trained as statisticians i enjoyed the data science venn diagram but i am starting to see a shift towards what is labelled as the danger zone and this is worrying     permalink  flag   reply

operate a selffunded independent data science research lab not owned by a university or a corporation and we regularly publish new research results available as open source ip  some is published in our data science ebook  some research ends up in patent filing and the creation of externally funded data science startups we see a lot of them being created recently     permalink  flag   reply         hector ureta  1 year ago    thank you for such a summary of the recent events and publications within the data science field i completely agree this is a new reality mixing some ideas from what in the past where independent fields and has a huge potential i would like to highlight with this comment what i consider a missing point of the article the input coming from from the complex systems that couldmayshould also feed the data science enabling an even more powerful tools that ds by itself  in the research center i work for innaxis spain we are currently trying to apply data science

century john tukey  i would add the netflix prize as a pivotal change in the field of data science launched in 2006 this competition drew significant attention to the importance of data science data mining statistics and data processing as a discipline that can create a significant competitive advantage in fact netflix ceo reed hastings has stated this one advantage moviematching was the key driver of most profits achieved by netflix  it took several years for a better algorithm to beat the netflix moviematching algorithm that was the basis of the prize but eventually a team developed an algorithm that was 10 better and won the 1m prize     permalink  flag   reply         carlo lauro  1 year ago    the origins of data science the 5 principles of data analysis analyse des donnees by jp benzecri  i find it very interesting the paper published in forbes a very short history of data science but for it forget the fundamental contribution by jp benzecri in the 60s  in the book lanalyze des donnees published by dunod benzecri in 1973 for the first time sets out the 5 major principles on which data analysis should be based  the first principle states that the statistics is not lprobability under the name of mathematicalstatistics was built a pompous discipline based on theoretical assumptions that are rarely met in practice the second principle states that the models should follow the data not vice versa in fact is asserting the priority of the data or the approach to the extraction of knowledge in an optical datadriven the third specifies that you must simultaneously process the information relating to the greater number of possible dimensions so as to provide a sufficiently complete representation of the phenomena of interest it seems that in this principle advances the role of thebig data finally the last two principles relate to the basic use of the computer to process the data for the analysis of complex phenomena facts the computer is indispensable and even use the computer implies the abandonment of all the techniques designed before of computing  this latter principle advocates finally the change of the paradigm of classical statistics  for these reasons i like to define data science as the statistics in the computer and internet age  see the discussion

of predictive analytics started in the 1960s it is true that advances in technology has made it easier to apply predictive analytics however it is important to understand that predictive analytics is not a new technology it has been used for centuries  i argue that predictive analytics has been around since 1689 httpcanworksmartcomhistoryofpredictiveanalytics     permalink  flag   reply

beginners  january 20 2014   by  dr bojan tunguz hall of fame top 50 reviewer    format kindle edition  verified purchase   data science and data scientists are the buzzwords that have been floating around for a few years now many of us who are either outsiders or ar on the outskirts of the information technology industry have not been quite sure of what they mean they seem to have something to do with statistics databases and software development but its not quite clear in what way this short book tries to explain what is meant by data science it is written from the perspective of information technology industry and silicon valley in particular data science has developed as a reaction of most internet giants google amazon facebook etc to the particular needs of their businesses and to collection and manipulation of enormous amounts of data distributed over thousands of computers in particular this short ebook gives several examples of particular industry problems that data science addresses and provides numerous links and references to the tools that have been developed for those tasks this ebook is written with the beginners in mind but it does assume familiarity with software and other it topics its well written and informative as far as it goes but it doesnt provide much in terms of how to get into the whole data science game furthermore as it was written and first published in 2011 it is probably pretty dated by now 2014 nonetheless its still a pretty good read       comment        was this review helpful to you    yes    no        1 of 1 people found the

 next  2 statistical inference exploratory data analysis and the data science process    chapter 1 introduction what is data science over the past few years theres been a lot of hype in the media about data science and big data a reasonable first reaction to all of this might be some combination of skepticism and confusion indeed we cathy and rachel had that exact reaction and we let ourselves indulge in our bewilderment for a while first separately and then once we met together over many wednesday morning breakfasts but we couldnt get rid of a nagging feeling that there was something real there perhaps something deep and profound representing a paradigm shift in our culture around data perhaps we considered its even a paradigm shift that plays to our strengths instead of ignoring it we decided to explore it more but before we go into that lets first delve into what struck us as confusing and vagueperhaps youve had similar inclinations after that well explain what made us get past our own concerns to the point where rachel created a course on data science at columbia university cathy blogged the course and youre now reading a book based on it big data and data science hype lets get this out of the way right off the bat because many of you are likely skeptical of data science already for many of the reasons we were we want to address this up front to let you know were right there with you  if youre a skeptic too it probably means you have something useful to contribute to making data science into a more legitimate field that has the power to have a positive impact on society so what is eyebrowraising about big data and data science lets count the ways theres a lack of definitions around the most basic terminology what is big data anyway what does data science mean what is the relationship between big data and data science is data science the science of big data is data science only the stuff going on in companies like google and facebook and tech companies why do many people refer to big data as crossing disciplines astronomy finance tech etc and to data science as only taking place in tech just how big is big or is it just a relative term these terms are so ambiguous theyre wellnigh meaningless theres a distinct lack of respect for the researchers in academia and industry labs who have been working on this kind of stuff for years and whose work is based on decades in some cases centuries of work by statisticians computer scientists mathematicians engineers and scientists of all types from the way the media describes it machine learning algorithms were just invented last week and data was never big until google came along this is simply not the case many of the methods and techniques were usingand the challenges were facing noware part of the evolution of everything thats come before this doesnt mean that theres not new and exciting stuff going on but we think its important to show some basic respect for everything that came before the hype is crazypeople throw around tired phrases straight out of the height of the prefinancial crisis era like masters of the universe to describe data scientists and that doesnt bode well in general hype masks reality and increases the noisetosignal ratio the longer the hype goes on the more many of us will get turned off by it and the harder it will be to see whats good underneath it all if anything statisticians already feel that they are studying and working on the science of data thats their bread and butter maybe you dear reader are not a statistican and dont care but imagine that for the statistician this feels a little bit like how identity theft might feel for you although we will make the case that data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself the media often describes data science in a way that makes it sound like as if its simply statistics or machine learning in the context of the tech industry people have said to us anything that has to call itself a science isnt although there might be truth in there that doesnt mean that the term data science itself represents nothing but of course what it represents may not be science but more of a craft getting past the hype rachels experience going from getting a phd in statistics to working at google is a great example to illustrate why we thought in spite of the aforementioned reasons to be dubious there might be some meat in the data science sandwich in her words it was clear to me pretty quickly that the stuff i was working on at google was different than anything i had learned at school when i got my phd in statistics this is not to say that my degree was useless far from itwhat id learned in school provided a framework and way of thinking that i relied on daily and much of the actual content provided a solid theoretical and practical foundation necessary to do my work but there were also many skills i had to acquire on the job at google that i hadnt learned in school of course my experience is specific to me in the sense that i had a statistics background and picked up more computation coding and visualization skills as well as domain expertise while at google another person coming in as a computer scientist or a social scientist or a physicist would have different gaps and would fill them in accordingly but what is important here is that as individuals we each had different strengths and gaps yet we were able to solve problems by putting ourselves together into a data team wellsuited to solve the data problems that came our way heres a reasonable response you might have to this story its a general truism that whenever you go from school to a real job you realize theres a gap between what you learned in school and what you do on the job in other words you were simply facing the difference between academic statistics and industry statistics we have a couple replies to this sure theres is a difference between industry and academia but does it really have to be that way why do many courses in school have to be so intrinsically out of touch with reality even so the gap doesnt represent simply a difference between industry statistics and academic statistics the general experience of data scientists is that at their job they have access to a larger body of knowledge and methodology  as well as a process which we now define as the data science process details in chapter 2  that has foundations in both statistics and computer science around all the hype in other words there is a ring of truth this is something new but at the same time its a fragile nascent idea at real risk of being rejected prematurely for one thing its being paraded around as a magic bullet raising unrealistic expectations that will surely be disappointed rachel gave herself the task of understanding the cultural phenomenon of data science and how others were experiencing it she started meeting with people at google at startups and tech companies and at universities mostly from within statistics departments from those meetings she started to form a clearer picture of the new thing thats emerging she ultimately decided to continue the investigation by giving a course at columbia called introduction to data science which cathy covered on her blog we figured that by the end of the semester we and hopefully the students would know what all this actually meant and now with this book we hope to do the same for many more people why now we have massive amounts of data about many aspects of our lives and simultaneously an abundance of inexpensive computing power shopping communicating reading news listening to music searching for information expressing our opinionsall this is being tracked online as most people know what people might not know is that the datafication of our offline behavior has started as well mirroring the online data collection revolution more on this later put the two together and theres a lot to learn about our behavior and by extension who we are as a species its not just internet data thoughits finance the medical industry pharmaceuticals bioinformatics social welfare government education retail and the list goes on there is a growing influence of data in most sectors and most industries in some cases the amount of data collected might be enough to be considered big more on this in the next chapter in other cases its not but its not only the massiveness that makes all this new data interesting or poses challenges its that the data itself often in real time becomes the building blocks of data products  on the internet this means amazon recommendation systems friend recommendations on facebook film and music recommendations and so on in finance this means credit ratings trading algorithms and models in education this is starting to mean dynamic personalized learning and assessments coming out of places like knewton and khan academy in government this means policies based on data were witnessing the beginning of a massive culturally saturated feedback loop where our behavior changes the product and the product changes our behavior technology makes this possible infrastructure for largescale data processing increased memory and bandwidth as well as a cultural acceptance of technology in the fabric of our lives this wasnt true a decade ago considering the impact of this feedback loop we should start thinking seriously about how its being conducted along with the ethical and technical responsibilities for the people responsible for the process one goal of this book is a first stab at that conversation datafication in the mayjune 2013 issue of foreign affairs  kenneth neil cukier and viktor mayerschoenberger wrote an article called the rise of big data  in it they discuss the concept of datafication and their example is how we quantify friendships with likes its the way everything we do online or otherwise ends up recorded for later examination in someones data storage units or maybe multiple storage units and maybe also for sale they define datafication as a process of taking all aspects of life and turning them into data as examples they mention that googles augmentedreality glasses datafy the gaze twitter datafies stray thoughts linkedin datafies professional networks datafication is an interesting concept and led us to consider its importance with respect to peoples intentions about sharing their own data we are being datafied or rather our actions are and when we like someone or something online we are intending to be datafied or at least we should expect to be but when we merely browse the web we are unintentionally or at least passively being datafied through cookies that we might or might not be aware of and when we walk around in a store or even on the street we are being datafied in a completely unintentional way via sensors cameras or google glasses this spectrum of intentionality ranges from us gleefully taking part in a social media experiment we are proud of to allout surveillance and stalking but its all datafication our intentions may run the gamut but the results dont they follow up their definition in the article with a line that speaks volumes about their perspective once we datafy things we can transform their purpose and turn the information into new forms of value heres an important question that we will come back to throughout the book who is we in that case what kinds of value do they refer to mostly given their examples the we is the modelers and entrepreneurs making money from getting people to buy stuff and the value translates into something like increased efficiency through automation if we want to think bigger if we want our we to refer to people in general well be swimming against the tide the current landscape with a little history so what is data science is it new or is it just statistics or analytics rebranded is it real or is it pure hype and if its new and if its real what does that mean this is an ongoing discussion but one way to understand whats going on in this industry is to look online and see what current discussions are taking place this doesnt necessarily tell us what data science is but it at least tells us what other people think it is or how theyre perceiving it for example on quora theres a discussion from 2010 about what is data science and heres metamarket ceo mike driscolls answer  data science as its practiced is a blend of redbullfueled hacking and espressoinspired statistics but data science is not merely hackingbecause when hackers finish debugging their bash oneliners and pig scripts few of them care about noneuclidean distance metrics and data science is not merely statistics because when statisticians finish theorizing the perfect model few could read a tabdelimited file into r if their job depended on it data science is the civil engineering of data its acolytes possess a practical knowledge of tools and materials coupled with a theoretical understanding of whats possible driscoll then refers to drew conways venn diagram of data science from 2010 shown in figure 11  figure 11 drew conways venn diagram of data science he also mentions the sexy skills of data geeks from nathan yaus 2009 post rise of the data scientist  which include statistics traditional analysis youre used to thinking about data munging parsing scraping and formatting data visualization graphs tools etc but wait is data science just a bag of tricks or is it the logical extension of other fields like statistics and machine learning for one argument see cosma shalizis posts here and here  and cathys posts here and here  which constitute an ongoing discussion of the difference between a statistician and a data scientist cosma basically argues that any statistics department worth its salt does all the stuff in the descriptions of data science that he sees and therefore data science is just a rebranding and unwelcome takeover of statistics for a slightly different perspective see asa president nancy gellers 2011 amstat news article dont shun the s word  in which she defends statistics we need to tell people that statisticians are the ones who make sense of the data deluge occurring in science engineering and medicine that statistics provides methods for data analysis in all fields from art history to zoology that it is exciting to be a statistician in the 21st century because of the many challenges brought about by the data explosion in all of these fields though we get her pointthe phrase art history to zoology is supposed to represent the concept of a to zshes kind of shooting herself in the foot with these examples because they dont correspond to the hightech world where much of the data explosion is coming from much of the development of the field is happening in industry not academia that is there are people with the job title data scientist in companies but no professors of data science in academia though this may be changing not long ago dj patil  described how he and jeff hammerbacher then at linkedin and facebook respectivelycoined the term data scientist in 2008 so that is when data scientist emerged as a job title wikipedia finally gained an entry on data science in 2012 it makes sense to us that once the skill set required to thrive at googleworking with a team on problems that required a hybrid skill set of stats and computer science paired with personal characteristics including curiosity and persistencespread to other silicon valley tech companies it required a new job title once it became a pattern it deserved a name and once it got a name everyone and their mother wanted to be one it got even worse when harvard business review declared data scientist to be the sexiest job of the 21st century  the role of the social scientist in data science both linkedin and facebook are social network companies oftentimes a description or definition of data scientist includes hybrid statistician software engineer and social scientist this made sense in the context of companies where the product was a social product and still makes sense when were dealing with human or user behavior but if you think about drew conways venn diagram data science problems cross disciplinesthats what the substantive expertise is referring to in other words it depends on the context of the problems youre trying to solve if theyre social sciencey problems like friend recommendations or people you know or user segmentation then by all means bring on the social scientist social scientists also do tend to be good question askers and have other good investigative qualities so a social scientist who also has the quantitative and programming chops makes a great data scientist but its almost a historical historical is in quotes because 2008 isnt that long ago artifact to limit your conception of a data scientist to someone who works only with online user behavior data theres another emerging field out there called computational social sciences which could be thought of as a subset of data science but we can go back even further in 2001 william cleveland wrote a position paper about data science called data science an action plan to expand the field of statistics so data science existed before data scientists is this semantics or does it make sense this all begs a few questions can you define data science by what data scientists do  who gets to define the field anyway theres lots of buzz and hypedoes the media get to define it or should we rely on the practitioners the selfappointed data scientists or is there some actual authority lets leave these as open questions for now though we will return to them throughout the book data science jobs columbia just decided to start an institute for data sciences and engineering with bloombergs help  there are 465 job openings in new york city alone for data scientists last time we checked thats a lot so even if data science isnt a real field it has real jobs and heres one thing we noticed about most of the job descriptions they ask data scientists to be experts in computer science statistics communication data visualization and to have extensive domain expertise nobody is an expert in everything which is why it makes more sense to create teams of people who have different profiles and different expertisetogether as a team they can specialize in all those things well talk about this more after we look at the composite set of skills in demand for todays data scientists a data science profile in the class rachel handed out index cards and asked everyone to profile themselves on a relative rather than absolute scale with respect to their skill levels in the following domains computer science math statistics machine learning domain expertise communication and presentation skills data visualization as an example figure 12 shows rachels data science profile figure 12 rachels data science profile which she created to illustrate trying to visualize oneself as a data scientist she wanted students and guest lecturers to riff on thisto add buckets or remove skills use a different scale or visualization method and think about the drawbacks of selfreporting we taped the index cards to the blackboard and got to see how everyone else thought of themselves there was quite a bit of variation which is coollots of people in the class were coming from social sciences for example where is your data science profile at the moment and where would you like it to be in a few months or years as we mentioned earlier a data science team works best when different skills profiles are represented across different people because nobody is good at everything it makes us wonder if it might be more worthwhile to define a data science teamas shown in figure 13 than to define a data scientist figure 13 data science team profiles can be constructed from data scientist profiles there should be alignment between the data science team profile and the profile of the data problems they try to solve thought experiment metadefinition every class had at least one thought experiment that the students discussed in groups most of the thought experiments were very openended and the intention was to provoke discussion about a wide variety of topics related to data science for the first class the initial thought experiment was can we use data science to define data science the class broke into small groups to think about and discuss this question here are a few interesting things that emerged from those conversations start with a textmining model we could do a google search for data science and perform a textmining model but that would depend on us being a usagist rather than a prescriptionist with respect to language a usagist would let the masses define data science where the masses refers to whatever googles search engine finds would it be better to be a prescriptionist and refer to an authority such as the oxford english dictionary  unfortunately the oed probably doesnt have an entry yet and we dont have time to wait for it lets agree that theres a spectrum that one authority doesnt feel right and that the masses doesnt either so what about a clustering algorithm how about we look at practitioners of data science and see how they describe what they do maybe in a word cloud for starters then we can look at how people who claim to be other things like statisticians or physicists or economists describe what they do from there we can try to use a clustering algorithm which well use in chapter 3  or some other model and see if when it gets as input the stuff someone does it gives a good prediction on what field that person is in just for comparison check out what harlan harris recently did related to the field of data science he took a survey and used clustering to define subfields of data science  which gave rise to figure 14  figure 14 harlan harriss clustering and visualization of subfields of data science from analyzing the analyzers oreilly by harlan harris sean murphy and marck vaisman  based on a  survey of several hundred data science practitioners in mid2012 ok so what is a data scientist really perhaps the most concrete approach is to define data science is by its usageeg what data scientists get paid to do with that as motivation well describe what data scientists do and well cheat a bit by talking first about data scientists in academia in academia the reality is that currently no one calls themselves a data scientist in academia except to take on a secondary title for the sake of being a part of a data science institute at a university or for applying for a grant that supplies money for data science research instead lets ask a related question who in academia plans to become a data scientist there were 60 students in the intro to data science class at columbia when rachel proposed the course she assumed the makeup of the students would mainly be statisticians applied mathematicians and computer scientists actually though it ended up being those people plus sociologists journalists political scientists biomedical informatics students students from nyc government agencies and nonprofits related to social welfare someone from the architecture school others from environmental engineering pure mathematicians business marketing students and students who already worked as data scientists they were all interested in figuring out ways to solve important problems often of social value with data for the term data science to catch on in academia at the level of the faculty and as a primary title the research area needs to be more formally defined note there is already a rich set of problems that could translate into many phd theses heres a stab at what this could look like an academic data scientist is a scientist trained in anything from social science to biology who works with large amounts of data and must grapple with computational problems posed by the structure size messiness and the complexity and nature of the data while simultaneously solving a realworld problem the case for articulating it like this is as follows across academic disciplines the computational and deep data problems have major commonalities if researchers across departments join forces they can solve multiple realworld problems from different domains in industry what do data scientists look like in industry it depends on the level of seniority and whether youre talking about the internetonline industry in particular the role of data scientist need not be exclusive to the tech world but thats where the term originated so for the purposes of the conversation let us say what it means there a chief data scientist should be setting the data strategy of the company which involves a variety of things setting everything up from the engineering and infrastructure for collecting data and logging to privacy concerns to deciding what data will be userfacing how data is going to be used to make decisions and how its going to be built back into the product she should manage a team of engineers scientists and analysts and should communicate with leadership across the company including the ceo cto and product leadership shell also be concerned with patenting innovative solutions and setting research goals more generally a data scientist is someone who knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data which requires both tools and methods from statistics and machine learning as well as being human she spends a lot of time in the process of collecting cleaning and munging data because data is never clean this process requires persistence statistics and software engineering skillsskills that are also  necessary for understanding biases in the data and for debugging logging output from code once she gets the data into shape a crucial part is exploratory data analysis which combines visualization and data sense shell find patterns build models and algorithmssome with the intention of understanding product usage and the overall health of the product and others to serve as prototypes that ultimately get baked back into the product she may design experiments and she is a critical part of datadriven decision making shell communicate with team members engineers and leadership in clear language and with data visualizations so that even if her colleagues are not immersed in the data themselves they will understand the implications thats

aS' what we do who we are what we think why we work how do i become a data scientist an evaluation of 3 alternatives august 4 2014 this is an old school classroom what do new classrooms look like one of the most frequent questions we hear right behind so what exactly is a data scientist or what makes a great data scientist  is how do i become one i should probably just get a masters right perhaps not anymore rising costs  changing demand  and the internet are disrupting this traditional path and providing two viable alternatives at the other extreme selflearning through massive open online courses moocs give access to courses at an extremely low cost often free but leave it as an exercise for the reader to identify a suitable set of courses and tools to round out a coherent skill set in the middle ground bootcamps offer students a structured learning environment at a far more affordable rate compared with obtaining a masters degree so which path do i take the triple life of audrey i want to be a data scientist heepbourne  as technology increases the rate of change of society the most successful workers will be those that can quickly shift to new specialties and learn on the job to meet market demands lets do a thought experiment to compare the three experiences lets say audrey heepbourne has a fouryear engineering degree from state university of new york audreys been working for a few years but is not particularly excited about her job shes excited by quantitative analysis occasionally writes macros in excel spreadsheets and heard that data science is sexy but doesnt know how to get started or even if she has what it takes to be a data scientist we see this in many potential data scientists all she needs is a nudge but she thinks shes worlds away believe in yourself audrey be bold tldr to help illustrate the different paths audrey can take to train in data science we describe in detail below three hypothetical scenarios if youre running out the door to catch a bus thats leaving in 5 minutes heres a table that summarizes our assessment table 1 summary of different options for training in data science masters selftaught moocs bootcamp learning theoryrich

talent placement manager helps with hunt ideal for people that enjoy immersing themselves in campus life and want to take time to let the new material absorb while learning in a structured environment with the full credentials of a university degree people that thrive with ambiguity and selfguided environments and are motivated enough to design a curriculum around their own strengths and weaknesses people that want to switch or accelerate careers asap with the confidence that the switch will result in a job they will like while learning in a structured environment otherwise click on any of the following sections to expand on      what audreys experience is like in these three different      training experiences masters in the masters scenario audrey takes a lot of core classes and some electives over 12 years 60000 all of which teach her a lot of the theoretical knowledge related to data related algorithms the courses have lots of problem sets and homework assignments that she works on with her classmates a few classes have final projects that are designed to assess whether audrey understands the theoretical knowledge but do not simulate her responsibilities at her future job she enjoys socializing with the 2030 other students in her program while participating in other aspects of campus life gaining one or two lifelong friends along the way table 2 small sample of various

that know the ins and outs of data analysis quite well but most of them have never used data to solve applied problems in industry a lot of them are good teachers with experience and expertise on the theoretical side of data science including proofs behind machine learning algorithms analytic derivations of formulas for statistical tests optimization of different data structures etc rather than industry experience of designing data science solutions for companies after completing her masters degree 18 months later audrey can add her 37 gpa a project or two and maybe even a summer internship to her resume she attends the universitywide campus recruiting day and interviews with a couple of companies and ends up joining the data science team at the company where she interned during the summer she spends the first six months at her new job learning how to connect a lot of the theory she learned with the day to day challenges of her projects at work audreys solid academic background continues to help her a lot with upcoming projects beyond that as well however she will still hit problems where she doesnt have the necessary knowledge yet she doesnt know everything and nor does anyone else selftaught mooc in the selftaught scenario audrey spends a considerable amount of time just googling around and learning the skills that she needs to have in order to be a data scientist she has to learn about the pros and cons of r vs python vs excel vs sas what the word hadoop means what databases are and whether they are relevant for her needs she also explores the world of moocs that are organized by johns hopkins stanford and beyond after taking two moocs at a time for the first cycle of classes 45 hours per week per class she realizes its a bit tricky to juggle her courses and work and decides to reduce her course load to one mooc at a time perhaps she does this during her current job or perhaps she heads to the local cafe after work but in either case it is largely a solo effort over 12 years table 3 small sample of various moocs  program duration tuition johns hopkins data science certificate 10 months 36 hrsweek free 490 for certificate stanford machine learning

shes learning a lot but wishes she could ask questions live during lecture rather than having to pause the video to google what the word responsibilities means in the context of a gaussian mixture model beyond the moocs she has found a really great python tutorial and is starting to build up enough programming experience to experiment with scipy pandas and scikitlearn as her confidence grows she signs up for a kaggle challenge and optimistically thinks she can place in the top 5 after working on it for a weekend only to realize that it takes a lot more effort than she had previously thought to optimize her solution to be a top contender in her spare time she searches around and reads up on how her learnings are applied in practice and starts experimenting with what shes learned to analyze her retirement portfolio and to mine the tweets of all the people she follows after taking the 9 certificate courses from johns hopkins and shoring up her machine learning with a few other classes she earns her data science certificate and adds it to her linkedin profile after four months of searching for a job she is contacted by a recruiter who ends up having a job thats a perfect fit for her not too far from where she lives she continues to learn about python data visualization and machine learning on the job with her team and starts to adapt her skills to solve practical problems when she hits a road block she is totally confident that she can find the answer because her google skillz are beyond reproach bootcamp in the bootcamp scenario audrey enters a 3month bootcamp at 10000 that is centered around completing one or more projects that are designed to replicate common projects in industry while the focus of the bootcamp is on teambased projectbased work she also learns the appropriate theory behind her analysis and why it is relevant to this project by getting a guided tour of relevant theory through practical application she is applying her theoretical learnings right away she enjoys the company of her teammates and the thrill of intensely focusing in a collaborative way with her peers some of which she suspects shell stay in touch with beyond the bootcamp table 4 small sample of various bootcamps  program duration tuition zipfian 3 months 40 hrsweek 16000 4000 credit metis 3 months 40 hrsweek 7000  14000 2000 credit general assembly 3 months 912 hrsweek 4000 insight phd required 15 months 40 hrsweek free the data incubator phd required 15 months 40 hrsweek free since audreys instructors at the bootcamp come from industry the focus is constantly on designing solutions that work in practice over and over again she faces practical questions like my project just hit a dead end for predicting if a given patient has the disease or not i tried the naive bayes algorithm and its doing terribly im not sure why what should i do now her instructors guide her towards other classification methods that would be more suitable to solve this type of problem audrey is able to learn about new tools and immediately put them to practice but this inevitably leads to further questions the process is cyclic and happens repeatedly through the help of her instructors audrey is becoming and expert in learning and applying relevant theory quickly while making efficient tangible progress on her project after graduating she has proof of her skills in the form of a portfolio she can show to potential employers to prove her value as a data scientist taking advantage of the career day and the talent placement manager that the bootcamp provides audrey lands a coveted position within a month after graduation her first month in her new job feels like a continuation of the bootcamp itself audrey doesnt know everything but she is equipped with the skills to quickly learn adapt and progress with her work project a love letter to bootcamps as technology increases the rate of change of society the most successful workers will be those that can quickly shift to new specialties and learn on the job to meet market demands the bootcamp provides the benefits of personalization credentialing and social learning that a masters degree offers but at an accelerated rate with experiential learning sure it is more expensive than being selftaught but the connection with employers and the guided experiential learning process increases your confidence to tackle the uncertain prospect of making a career switch to become a data scientist you dont need to have postgraduate degrees or 20 years of experience or be proficient with every datarelated technique and tool under the sun what you need is to have enough baseline knowledge and experience and the skill to constantly adapt and learn bootcamps in our opinion are the perfect medium for making the transition full disclosure we designed a bootcamp since we love the bootcamp format so much when metis a part of kaplan  contacted us about partnering to design a data science bootcamp we jumped at the opportunity we thought we could take all these points we see as the advantages of the format and elevate them as much as we could so we designed a course that would give audrey a lot of experience with 45 projects and a guided route of several core data science concepts and approaches she can quickly build the necessary foundation without the burden of teaching herself everything or paying the handsome price of a masters program before realizing her dream job the first metis data science bootcamp is starting on september 2 in new york applications due by august 11 and you can learn more about it here if youre interested contributors to this post dean malmgren mike stringer irmak sirer aaron laurie tweet like this post we think you might also enjoy

wall street quant were the hot occupations in business today data scientists are the hires firms are competing to make as companies wrestle with unprecedented volumes and types of information demand for these experts has raced well ahead of supply indeed greylock partners the vc firm that backed facebook and linkedin is so worried about the shortage of data scientists that it has a recruiting team dedicated to channeling them to the businesses in its portfolio data scientists are the key to realizing the opportunities presented by big data they bring structure to it find compelling patterns in it and advise executives on the implications for products processes and decisions they find the story buried in the data and communicate it and they dont just deliver reports they get at the questions at the heart of problems and devise creative approaches to them one data scientist who was studying a fraud problem for example realized it was analogous to a type of dna sequencing problem bringing those disparate worlds together he crafted a solution that dramatically reduced fraud losses in this article harvard business schools davenport and greylocks patil take a deep dive on what organizations need to know about data scientists where to look for them how to attract and develop them and how to spot a great one    when jonathan goldman arrived for work in june 2006 at linkedin the business networking site the place still felt like a startup the company had just under 8 million accounts and the number was growing quickly as existing members invited their friends and colleagues to join but users werent seeking out connections with the people who were already on the site at the rate executives had expected something was apparently missing in the social experience as one linkedin manager put it it was like arriving at a conference reception and realizing you dont know anyone so you just stand in the corner sipping your drinkand you probably leave early goldman a phd in physics from stanford was intrigued by the linking he did see going on and by the richness of the user profiles it all made for messy data and unwieldy analysis but as he began exploring peoples connections he started to see possibilities he began forming theories testing hunches and finding patterns that allowed him to predict whose networks a given profile would land in he could imagine that new features capitalizing on the heuristics he was developing might provide value to users but linkedins engineering team caught up in the challenges of scaling up the site seemed uninterested some colleagues were openly dismissive of goldmans ideas why would users need linkedin to figure out their networks for them the site already had an address book importer that could pull in all a members connections luckily reid hoffman linkedins cofounder and ceo at the time now its executive chairman had faith in the power of analytics because of his experiences at paypal and he had granted goldman a high degree of autonomy for one thing he had given goldman a way to circumvent the traditional product release cycle by publishing small modules in the form of ads on the sites most popular pages through one such module goldman started to test what would happen if you presented users with names of people they hadnt yet connected with but seemed likely to knowfor example people who had shared their tenures at schools and workplaces he did this by ginning up a custom ad that displayed the three best new matches for each user based on the background entered in his or her linkedin profile within days it was obvious that something remarkable was taking place the clickthrough rate on those ads was the highest ever seen goldman continued to refine how the suggestions were generated incorporating networking ideas such as triangle closingthe notion that if you know larry and sue theres a good chance that larry and sue know each other goldman and his team also got the action required to respond to a suggestion down to one click   the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors  it didnt take long for linkedins top managers to recognize a good idea and make it a standard feature thats when things really took off people you may know ads achieved a clickthrough rate 30 higher than the rate obtained by other prompts to visit more pages on the site they generated millions of new page views thanks to this one feature linkedins growth trajectory shifted significantly upward a new breed goldman is a good example of a new key player in organizations the data scientist its a highranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data the title has been around for only a few years it was coined in 2008 by one of us dj patil and jeff hammerbacher then the respective leads of data and analytics efforts at linkedin and facebook but thousands of data scientists are already working at both startups and wellestablished companies their sudden appearance on the business scene reflects the fact that companies are now wrestling with information that comes in varieties and volumes never encountered before if your organization stores multiple petabytes of data if the information most critical to your business resides in forms other than rows and columns of numbers or if answering your biggest question would involve a mashup of several analytical efforts youve got a big data opportunity much of the current enthusiasm for big data focuses on technologies that make taming it possible including hadoop the most widely used framework for distributed file system processing and related opensource tools cloud computing and data visualization while those are important breakthroughs at least as important are the people with the skill set and the mindset to put them to good use on this front demand has raced ahead of supply indeed the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors greylock partners an earlystage venture firm that has backed companies such as facebook linkedin palo alto networks and workday is worried enough about the tight labor pool that it has built its own specialized recruiting team to channel talent to businesses in its portfolio once they have data says dan portillo who leads that team they really need people who can manage it and find insights in it who are these people if capitalizing on big data depends on hiring scarce data scientists then the challenge for managers is to learn how to identify that talent attract it to an enterprise and make it productive none of those tasks is as straightforward as it is with other established organizational roles start with the fact that there are no university programs offering degrees in data science there is also little consensus on where the role fits in an organization how data scientists can add the most value and how their performance should be measured the first step in filling the need for data scientists therefore is to understand what they do in businesses then ask what skills do they need and what fields are those skills most readily found in more than anything what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data its their preferred method of navigating the world around them at ease in the digital realm they are able to bring structure to large quantities of formless data and make analysis possible they identify rich data sources join them with other potentially incomplete data sources and clean the resulting set in a competitive landscape where challenges keep changing and data never stop flowing data scientists help decision makers shift from ad hoc analysis to an ongoing conversation with data data scientists realize that they face technical limitations but they dont allow that to bog down their search for novel solutions as they make discoveries they communicate what theyve learned and suggest its implications for new business directions often they are creative in displaying information visually and making the patterns they find clear and compelling they advise executives and product managers on the implications of the data for products processes and decisions given the nascent state of their trade it often falls to data scientists to fashion their own tools and even conduct academicstyle research yahoo one of the firms that employed a group of data scientists early on was instrumental in developing hadoop facebooks data team created the language hive for programming hadoop projects many other data scientists especially at datadriven companies such as google amazon microsoft walmart ebay linkedin and twitter have added to and refined the tool kit what kind of person does all this what abilities make a data scientist successful think of him or her as a hybrid of data hacker analyst communicator and trusted adviser the combination is extremely powerfuland rare             further reading   big data the management revolution   competitive strategy  feature    andrew mcafee and erik brynjolfsson   the challenges of becoming a big dataenabled organization require handsonor in some cases handsoffleadership      save  share    data scientists most basic universal skill is the ability to write code this may be less true in five years time when many more people will have the title data scientist on their business cards more enduring will be the need for data scientists to communicate in language that all their stakeholders understandand to demonstrate the special skills involved in storytelling with data whether verbally visually orideallyboth but we would say the dominant trait among data scientists is an intense curiositya desire to go beneath the surface of a problem find the questions at its heart and distill them into a very clear set of hypotheses that can be tested this often entails the associative thinking that characterizes the most creative scientists in any field for example we know of a data scientist studying a fraud problem who realized that it was analogous to a type of dna sequencing problem by bringing together those disparate worlds he and his team were able to craft a solution that dramatically reduced fraud losses perhaps its becoming clear why the word scientist fits this emerging role experimental physicists for example also have to design equipment gather data conduct multiple experiments and communicate their results thus companies looking for people who can work with complex data have had good luck recruiting among those with educational and work backgrounds in the physical or social sciences some of the best and brightest data scientists are phds in esoteric fields like ecology and systems biology george roumeliotis the head of a data science team at intuit in silicon valley holds a doctorate in astrophysics a little less surprisingly many of the data scientists working in business today were formally trained in computer science math or economics they can emerge from any field that has a strong data and computational focus its important to keep that image of the scientist in mindbecause the word data might easily send a search for talent down the wrong path as portillo told us the traditional backgrounds of people you saw 10 to 15 years ago just dont cut it these days a quantitative analyst can be great at analyzing data but not at subduing a mass of unstructured data and getting it into a form in which it can be analyzed a data management expert might be great at generating and organizing data in structured form but not at turning unstructured data into structured dataand also not at actually analyzing the data and while people without strong social skills might thrive in traditional data professions data scientists must have such skills to be effective  how to find the data scientists you need   1 focus recruiting at the usual suspect universities stanford mit berkeley harvard carnegie mellon and also at a few others with proven strengths north carolina state uc santa cruz the university of maryland the university of washington and ut austin  2 scan the membership rolls of user groups devoted to data science tools the r user groups for an opensource statistical tool favored by data scientists and python interest groups for piggies are good places to start  3 search for data scientists on linkedintheyre almost all on there and you can see if they have the skills you want  4 hang out with data scientists at the strata structuredata and hadoop world conferences and similar gatherings there is almost one a week now or at informal data scientist meetups in the bay area boston new york washington dc london singapore and sydney  5 make friends with a local venture capitalist who is likely to have gotten a variety of big data proposals over the past year  6 host a competition on kaggle or topcoder the analytics and coding competition sites follow up with the mostcreative entrants  7 dont bother with any candidate who cant code coding skills dont have to be at a worldclass level but should be good enough to get by look for evidence too that candidates learn rapidly about new technologies and methods  8 make sure a candidate can find a story in a data set and provide a coherent narrative about a key data insight test whether he or she can communicate with numbers visually and verbally  9 be wary of candidates who are too detached from the business world when you ask how their work might apply to your management challenges are they stuck for answers  10 ask candidates about their favorite analysis or insight and how they are keeping their skills sharp have they gotten a certificate in the advanced track of stanfords online machine learning course contributed to opensource projects or built an online repository of code to share for example on github  roumeliotis was clear with us that he doesnt hire on the basis of statistical or analytical capabilities he begins his search for data scientists by asking candidates if they can develop prototypes in a mainstream programming language such as java roumeliotis seeks both a skill seta solid foundation in math statistics probability and computer scienceand certain habits of mind he wants people with a feel for business issues and empathy for customers then he says he builds on all that with onthejob training and an occasional course in a particular technology several universities are planning to launch data science programs and existing programs in analytics such as the master of science in analytics program at north carolina state are busy adding big data exercises and coursework some companies are also trying to develop their own data scientists after acquiring the big data firm greenplum emc decided that the availability of data scientists would be a gating factor in its ownand customersexploitation of big data so its education services division launched a data science and big data analytics training and certification program emc makes the program available to both employees and customers and some of its graduates are already working on internal big data initiatives   data scientists want to build things not just give advice one describes being a consultant as the dead zone  as educational offerings proliferate the pipeline of talent should expand vendors of big data technologies are also working to make them easier to use in the meantime one data scientist has come up with a creative approach to closing the gap the insight data science fellows program a postdoctoral fellowship designed by jake klamka a highenergy physicist by training takes scientists from academia and in six weeks prepares them to succeed as data scientists the program combines mentoring by data experts from local companies such as facebook twitter google and linkedin with exposure to actual big data challenges originally aiming for 10 fellows klamka wound up accepting 30 from an applicant pool numbering more than 200 more organizations are now lining up to participate the demand from companies has been phenomenal klamka told us they just cant get this kind of highquality talent why would a data scientist want to work here even as the ranks of data scientists swell competition for top talent will remain fierce expect candidates to size up employment opportunities on the basis of how interesting the big data challenges are as one of them commented if we wanted to work with structured data wed be on wall street given that todays most qualified prospects come from nonbusiness backgrounds hiring managers may need to figure out how to paint an exciting picture of the potential for breakthroughs that their problems offer pay will of course be a factor a good data scientist will have many doors open to him or her and salaries will be bid upward several data scientists working at startups commented that theyd demanded and got large stock option packages even for someone accepting a position for other reasons compensation signals a level of respect and the value the role is expected to add to the business but our informal survey of the priorities of data scientists revealed something more fundamentally important they want to be on the bridge the reference is to the 1960s television show star trek in which the starship captain james kirk relies heavily on data supplied by mr spock data scientists want to be in the thick of a developing situation with realtime awareness of the evolving set of choices it presents considering the difficulty of finding and keeping data scientists one would think that a good strategy would involve hiring them as consultants most consulting firms have yet to assemble many of them even the largest firms such as accenture deloitte and ibm global services are in the early stages of leading big data projects for their clients the skills of the data scientists they do have on staff are mainly being applied to moreconventional quantitative analysis problems offshore analytics services firms such as mu sigma might be the ones to make the first major inroads with data scientists          but the data scientists weve spoken with say they want to build things not just give advice to a decision maker one described being a consultant as the dead zoneall you get to do is tell someone else what the analyses say they should do by creating solutions that work they can have more impact and leave their marks as pioneers of their profession care and feeding data scientists dont do well on a short leash they should have the freedom to experiment and explore possibilities that said they need close relationships with the rest of the business the most important ties for them to forge are with executives in charge of products and services rather than with people overseeing business functions as the story of jonathan goldman illustrates their greatest opportunity to add value is not in creating reports or presentations for senior executives but in innovating with customerfacing products and processes linkedin isnt the only company to use data scientists to generate ideas for products features and valueadding services at intuit data scientists are asked to develop insights for smallbusiness customers and consumers and report to a new senior vice president of big data social design and marketing ge is already using data science to optimize the service contracts and maintenance intervals for industrial products google of course uses data scientists to refine its core search and adserving algorithms zynga uses data scientists to optimize the game experience for both longterm engagement and revenue netflix created the wellknown netflix prize given to the data science team that developed the best way to improve the companys movie recommendation system the testpreparation firm kaplan uses its data scientists to uncover effective learning strategies   data scientists today are akin to the wall street quants of the 1980s and 1990s  there is however a potential downside to having people with sophisticated skills in a fastevolving field spend their time among general management colleagues theyll have less interaction with similar specialists which they need to keep their skills sharp and their tool kit stateoftheart data scientists have to connect with communities of practice either within large firms or externally new conferences and informal associations are springing up to support collaboration and technology sharing and companies should encourage scientists to become involved in them with the understanding that more water in the harbor floats all boats data scientists tend to be more motivated too when more is expected of them the challenges of accessing and structuring big data sometimes leave little time or energy for sophisticated analytics involving prediction or optimization yet if executives make it clear that simple reports are not enough data scientists will devote more effort to advanced analytics big data shouldnt equal small math the hot job of the decade hal varian the chief economist at google is known to have said the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians people think im joking but who wouldve guessed that computer engineers wouldve been the sexy job of the 1990s if sexy means having rare qualities that are much in demand data scientists are already there they are difficult and expensive to hire and given the very competitive market for their services difficult to retain there simply arent a lot of people with their combination of scientific background and computational and analytical skills data scientists today are akin to wall street quants of the 1980s and 1990s in those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies then a variety of universities developed masters programs in financial engineering which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms the pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs  one question raised by this is whether some firms would be wise to wait until that second generation of data scientists emerges and the candidates are more numerous less expensive and easier to vet and assimilate in a business setting why not leave the trouble of hunting down and domesticating exotic talent to the big data startups and to firms like ge and walmart whose aggressive strategies require them to be at the forefront the problem with that reasoning is that the advance of big data shows no signs of slowing if companies sit out this trends early days for lack of talent they risk falling behind as competitors and channel partners gain nearly unassailable advantages think of big data as an epic wave gathering now starting to crest if you want to catch it you need people who can surf   a version of this article appeared in the october 2012 issue of
